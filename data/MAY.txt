Unveiling a Lighter Twist: Zucchini Zaalouk - A Moroccan Delight

Zaalouk, a cornerstone of Moroccan cuisine, traditionally boasts a vibrant blend of roasted eggplant, tomatoes, and spices. Today, we embark on a delightful detour, crafting a lighter version – Zucchini Zaalouk! This recipe substitutes zucchinis for eggplants, resulting in a refreshing and flavorful dip that maintains the essence of the classic.

But wait, there's more! You can also transform this recipe into a low-FODMAP haven by swapping out the garlic with homemade garlic-infused olive oil. This simple substitution retains the essence of garlic's aroma and flavor without triggering digestive discomfort.

Why Grate and Squeeze Zucchini?
Zucchinis, compared to eggplants, boast a higher water content. Grating them ensures even flavor distribution and faster cooking. Squeezing out the excess water prevents the dip from becoming watery and ensures a beautifully textured final product.

Creating Low-FODMAP Garlic-Infused Oil (Quick Method):
Here's a quick and easy way to make your own garlic-infused olive oil:
Heat it Up: In a small saucepan, gently heat ¼ cup of olive oil over low heat.
Garlic Symphony: Add 1-2 cloves of garlic, smashed, ensuring they don't brown.
Infuse, Don't Fry: Let the garlic simmer in the oil for 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to infuse without browning. Browning can introduce bitterness.
Strain and Store: Remove the garlic cloves from the oil using a slotted spoon. Store the infused oil in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.

This simple process infuses the oil with a subtle garlic flavor, perfect for low-FODMAP cooking!

Ingredients:
3 large zucchini, grated and squeezed
3 medium ripe tomatoes, grated or processed in a food processor (or use 1/2 cup tomato sauce)
1 clove garlic, minced (or garlic infused olive oil for a LOW-FODMAP option)
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon cumin
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped (or 1 tablespoon dried)
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped (or 1 tablespoon dried)
Salt, to taste

Method:
Grate and Squeeze the Zucchinis: Grate the zucchinis using the coarse side of a box grater. Place the grated zucchini in a colander and sprinkle generously with salt. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes. This draws out excess moisture. Squeeze the grated zucchini firmly with your hands to remove as much water as possible.
Sauté the Aromatics: Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant.
Introduce the Spices: Stir in the paprika and cumin, toasting them for another 30 seconds to release their aromas.
Tomato Time: Add the grated tomatoes or tomato sauce. Season with a pinch of salt and simmer for 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
Herb Symphony: Stir in the chopped parsley and cilantro. Let them cook for another minute, until fragrant.
Incorporate the Zucchini: Add the squeezed zucchini to the pan. Stir well to combine with the flavorful tomato mixture.
Simmering to Perfection: Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally. You want the zucchini to become very tender and slightly caramelized around the edges. 
Taste and Adjust: Season the Zaalouk with salt to taste.​

Serving Suggestions and Storage:
Enjoy your warm Zucchini Zaalouk as a dip with pita bread, crackers, or fresh vegetables. It can also be served chilled as a light salad component or a refreshing side dish alongside grilled meats. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop before serving.

This Zucchini Zaalouk offers a delightful twist on the classic Moroccan recipe. It's a perfect choice for those seeking a lighter alternative, while still capturing the essence of the traditional flavors. So, grab your zucchinis and embark on a culinary adventure to Morocco with this vibrant and flavorful dip!

A Gluten-Free Twist on Tradition:
This version utilizes a combination of gluten-free flours like rice flour, starch blends, and psyllium husk to create a wonderfully pliable dough. The psyllium husk acts as a binder, mimicking the gluten found in traditional wheat flour. The result is a light and airy crust that perfectly complements the sweet and savory filling.

Ingredients:
For the Dough:
240 grams rice flour (brown or white), or a mix of brown rice flour, oat flour, sorghum flour, and millet flour
120 grams starch (mix of potato and tapioca, or just tapioca, or mix with cornstarch)
15 grams whole psyllium husk
7 grams active dry yeast
2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon sugar
120 grams lactose-free Greek yogurt, plant-based yogurt, or normal plain yogurt
2 cups of warm water

For the Filling:
500 grams ground turkey
Handful of fresh parsley, chopped
Handful of  fresh coriander (cilantro), chopped
2 scallions, finely chopped
2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon ground ginger

For the Pide:
Chopped olives (optional)
Grated cheese (optional)
1 egg for egg wash

Instructions:

Making the Dough:
Activate the Yeast: In a small bowl, combine the yeast with the sugar and 1/2 cup of warm water. Stir gently and let it sit for 5 minutes until a foamy layer forms.
Prepare the Psyllium Gel: In a separate bowl, whisk the psyllium husk with the remaining 1 1/2 cups of warm water. Leave it to sit for 5 minutes, allowing the psyllium husk to absorb the water and form a thick gel.
Combine Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the rice flour blend, starch blend, salt, and psyllium husk mixture.
Mix and Knead: Add the activated yeast mixture and yogurt to the dry ingredients. Using a dough hook or your hands, knead the dough until it becomes smooth, elastic, and slightly sticky. The dough may feel drier than regular wheat dough, but this is normal for gluten-free dough.
Rest and Rise: Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest in a warm place for 30 minutes. This allows the psyllium husk to fully hydrate and the dough to develop its structure.

Preparing the Filling:
Heat Up the Pan: Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add a drizzle of olive oil.
Sauté the Aromatics: Once the oil is hot, toss in the finely chopped scallions and sauté until softened and fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Spice Up the Mix: Add the raw ground turkey to the pan with the softened scallions. Season generously with the chopped parsley, coriander, ground cumin, paprika, cinnamon, and ginger. Stir everything to combine well, ensuring the spices coat the turkey.
Sweet & Savory Journey: Now, add the pomegranate molasses and brown sugar to the pan. Stir well to distribute evenly throughout the mixture.
Cook Until Caramelized: Increase the heat slightly to medium-high and cook the ground turkey mixture, breaking it up with a spoon as it browns. Continue cooking until the turkey is fully cooked through and the sugars in the molasses and brown sugar begin to caramelize, giving it a nice brown color and a deeper flavor profile. This process should take about 7-10 minutes. Let your filling cool. 

Shaping the Pide:
Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C) and place a pizza stone or baking sheet inside to preheat as well. This creates a hot surface for even baking.
Divide the Dough: Divide the rested dough into 6 equal portions. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each portion into an oval shape, approximately 1/4-inch thick.
Forming the Boat: Here comes the fun part, shaping the pide! Imagine a boat: Picture a long oval shape for your dough.
Fold the Sides Up: Pinch the longer sides of the oval upwards, creating a slight ridge along the center of the dough. This ridge will become the "hull" of your pide boat.
Seal the Ends: Bring the shorter ends of the oval together, overlapping slightly, and pinch them to seal. You want to ensure the filling doesn't leak out during baking.

Filling and Finishing Touches:
Spoon in the Flavor: Evenly distribute a generous portion of the cooled filling along the center of each pide boat, leaving a small border around the edges.
Optional Toppings: If desired, sprinkle your pide with some chopped olives and/or grated cheese for an extra layer of flavor and texture.
Egg Wash for Shine: Whisk the egg in a small bowl. Using a pastry brush, gently brush the exposed dough edges of each pide with the egg wash. This helps create a beautiful golden brown color during baking.

Baking to Perfection:
Transfer to Hot Surface: Carefully transfer the assembled pide onto your preheated pizza stone or baking sheet.
Golden Goodness: Bake the pide for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is heated through. Keep an eye on them during baking to avoid burning.

Tips for Success:
Don't Overwork the Dough: Gluten-free doughs can become tough if overworked. Knead until just combined and slightly sticky.
Preheat Your Baking Surface: Preheating the pizza stone or baking sheet ensures a crispy bottom crust.
Cooling the Filling: Letting the filling cool prevents it from soaking the dough and creating a soggy bottom. ​
Picture
Serving Suggestions and Storage:
Enjoy your warm homemade pide for a delightful lunch, light dinner, or even a fun appetizer. They pair well with a side salad, yogurt dip, or your favorite dipping sauce. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in a pan or oven until warmed through.

This gluten-free Turkish Pide recipe offers a delicious and unexpected twist on the classic savory version. The sweet and savory combination of the ground turkey filling, infused with warm spices and pomegranate molasses, encased in a light and airy gluten-free crust, is sure to tantalize your taste buds. So, ditch the store-bought flatbreads and embark on a culinary adventure with this delightful gluten-free pide recipe!

Ingredients:

For the Fish and Rice Marinade (and Garnish):
500g White Fish of your choice (Skinless and cut into pieces) - Sole, cod, or hake are excellent options.
2 Cups Jasmine Rice, Washed
3 Large Scallions, Caramelized (See instructions below)
1 Tbsp Paprika
1 Tbsp Cumin
1 Tsp Cinnamon
1 Tsp Turmeric
1 Tsp Coriander powder
1 Tsp Tomato paste
1 Tsp Ginger powder
Salt to taste
2 Tbsp Olive Oil
2 Tbsp Water
Juice of ½ Lemon

For Cooking the Rice:
Half of the Prepared Marinade
2 Bay Leaves
3 Cardamom Pods, Crushed
2 Cups Water

For the Garnish:
Roasted Pine nuts (See instructions below)
1 Roasted Eggplant, Diced (See instructions below)
Remaining Caramelized Scallions

Yogurt Sauce (Optional):
1 Cup Plain Yogurt
1 Tbsp Chopped Mint
1 Tbsp Chopped Dill
Salt to taste
Squeeze of Lemon Juice

Instructions:
Caramelized Scallions:
Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a pan over medium heat.
Thinly slice the scallions (white and light green parts).
Add the sliced scallions to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until they soften and turn golden brown. This takes about 10-15 minutes.
Remove the caramelized scallions from the pan and set aside for the marinade and garnish.

The Marinade:
In a blender, combine half of the caramelized scallions, all the spices (paprika, cumin, cinnamon, turmeric, coriander powder, ginger powder), tomato paste, olive oil, water, and lemon juice. Blend until a smooth paste forms.

Marinating the Fish:
In a bowl, marinate the fish pieces with the prepared marinade for at least 2 hours, or overnight, in the refrigerator. This allows the flavors to deeply infuse the fish.

Cooking the Rice:
In a pot, combine the washed rice with the remaining half of the marinade, bay leaves, crushed cardamom pods, and water.
Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat.
Once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover the pot tightly with a lid, and simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and fluffy.

Tip for Fluffy Rice: The key to fluffy rice is using the right water-to-rice ratio and avoiding peeking under the lid while it cooks. The steam trapped inside helps achieve the desired fluffy texture.

Baking the Fish:
Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C).
Lightly grease a baking dish. Arrange the marinated fish pieces in a single layer on the prepared dish.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and slightly browned on the edges. 

Roasting the Pine Nuts
Place a dry skillet (no oil needed) over medium heat. Once hot, add the pine nuts in a single layer. Cook the pine nuts, stirring frequently, for about 3-5 minutes. They will toast quickly, so keep a close eye on them to prevent burning. 
The pine nuts are done when they turn golden brown and become fragrant. As soon as they're toasted, remove them from the hot pan and transfer them to a plate to cool. This prevents them from overcooking.

Roasting the Eggplant:
Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
Cut the eggplant into cubes or slices. Brush them lightly with olive oil.
Place the eggplant on a baking sheet and roast for 20-25 minutes, or until tender and slightly browned, flipping them halfway through.

Now that you have all your components ready let's assemble the Sayadieh!
​
Assembling the Sayadieh:
In a serving dish, spread half of the cooked rice as the base.
Top it with some of the remaining caramelized scallions, half your roasted pine nuts, and half your roasted eggplants  ​
Next, arrange half of the cooked fish pieces. 
Add the remaining cooked rice on top, creating a second layer.
Garnish the top layer with the remaining fish, roasted pine nuts and roasted eggplant cubes. 
For an extra touch of elegance, add a few sprigs of fresh parsley.​






Yogurt Sauce (Optional):
In a bowl, combine plain yogurt, chopped mint, chopped dill, salt to taste, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Whisk until smooth and creamy.
Serve the yogurt sauce on the side for those who prefer a touch of coolness and tang to complement the savory flavors of the sayadieh.

​Enjoy!

Tips:
Feel free to experiment with different types of white fish. Cod, hake, or tilapia can be good substitutes for sole.

Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in the oven or microwave until warmed through.

Sayadieh is a comforting and flavorful dish, perfect for a family gathering or a special occasion. This revisited version offers a vibrant twist while staying true to the essence of this Lebanese classic. So, embark on this culinary journey, create your own sayadieh masterpiece, and savor the delicious results!


Gluten Free Moroccan Couscous: A Quick and Easy Pressure Cooker Version (No steaming pot required)

A Culinary Journey Through Time: Unveiling the Origins of Moroccan Couscous

Imagine the bustling marketplaces of ancient North Africa, filled with the heady aroma of spices and the lively chatter of Berber tribes. It's here, amidst this vibrant tapestry of life, that historians believe the magic of Moroccan Couscous was born.

Tracing the Roots:
While the exact origin story remains shrouded in some mystery, historical evidence suggests couscous emerged sometime between the 2nd and 11th centuries AD among the Berber people. These resourceful nomads, known for their adaptability to harsh desert environments, needed a food that was both portable and shelf-stable. Couscous, with its tiny, dried semolina pearls, perfectly fit the bill.

​Food for the Desert:
The beauty of couscous lies in its simplicity. Made from coarsely ground durum wheat, it required minimal water for preparation – a crucial factor for desert dwellers. Additionally, the drying process allowed for long-term storage, ensuring a readily available source of sustenance during long journeys.

The Rise of Couscous Fridays:
Fast forward to the arrival of Islam in North Africa around the 7th century AD. The concept of "couscous Fridays" is believed to have emerged during this period. Friday, the Islamic holy day, became a time for families and communities to gather for a communal meal. Couscous, with its ability to feed a large crowd, became the centerpiece of these gatherings.

The Power of Shared Experience:
The preparation of couscous itself fostered a sense of community and social connection. Traditionally, women would come together, sharing stories and laughter while meticulously hand-rolling the semolina into tiny pearls. This collaborative effort solidified the bonds within the community.

A Culinary Legacy:
The Arab conquest of North Africa in the 7th-8th centuries further propelled the popularity of couscous. Arab traders carried the dish across the Mediterranean, introducing it to new cultures and cuisines. Today, couscous variations are enjoyed across the globe, each reflecting the unique flavors and traditions of its adopted home.

Modernizing the Magic:
While the traditional methods of preparing couscous offer a rich cultural experience, time constraints and busy lifestyles of the modern world often call for alternative approaches. This recipe presents a modern and convenient twist on the beloved Moroccan Couscous. We'll be utilizing the power of a pressure cooker to create a quick and easy version of this classic dish, all while keeping it gluten-free!

The Essential Elements:
This recipe breaks down the Moroccan Couscous into three key components:
The Meat and Vegetable Broth: A base brimming with aromatic spices, simmered with succulent meat and a variety of colorful vegetables.
The Gluten-Free Couscous: Fluffy and flavorful, cooked in a quick and easy method.
The Tfaya (Caramelized Topping): A sweet and savory onion topping that adds a delightful textural and flavor contrast to the dish.​
Picture

Ingredients:
For the Meat and Vegetable Broth:
500 g (1.1 lb) Beef, Lamb Chunks, or Chicken (your choice)
2 Large Onions, grated
2 tbsp Butter
2 Ripe Tomatoes
A large handful of chopped Coriander (Cilantro)
1 tsp Turmeric
Salt and Pepper to taste
1 tsp Ras el Hanout (optional) - a Moroccan spice blend
1 tbsp Tomato Paste
1 tbsp Vegetable Stock Powder or Cube
5-10 Saffron Threads, steeped in warm water
Water (5-10 cups) - adjust based on desired broth volume

Vegetables (Choose any you like):
2 Potatoes
2 Sweet Potatoes
5 Carrots
3 Zucchini
1/2 Pumpkin (optional)
1 Can Cooked Chickpeas

For the Tfaya (Caramelized Topping):
5 Large Onions, thinly sliced
1/2 tsp Cinnamon Powder
2 Large Cinnamon Sticks
1 tsp Salt
1 tbsp Butter
1 tbsp Olive Oil
3 tbsp Honey
1-2 tbsp Brown Sugar (adjust based on sweetness preference)

For the Gluten-Free Couscous:
3 cups Rice Semolina (or Corn Semolina for another gluten-free option)
3.5 cups Water
1 tbsp Butter
1 tsp Vegetable Stock Powder
Salt to taste

Method:
The Pressure Cooker Magic:
Building the Flavor Base: In your electric pressure cooker, melt the butter and olive oil. Add the grated onions and all the spices (turmeric, Ras el Hanout if using, stock powder, salt, and pepper). Sauté for 5 minutes, allowing the enticing aromas to release.
Sealing in the Flavor: Add your chosen meat and cook until it loses its raw red color.
Introducing the Broth: Add the grated tomatoes, chopped coriander, and the steeped saffron water. Stir well to combine.
Veggies in Stages: Next, add the carrots (or any other vegetables that take longer to cook). Pour in enough water to cover the carrots and meat. Close the pressure cooker lid, ensure the pressure valve is set correctly, and cook on high pressure for 20 minutes.
Softening the Rest: Once the pressure cooking cycle is complete, let the pressure release naturally for before doing a quick release. Open the lid and add the remaining vegetables (potatoes cook quickly, so add them later to prevent them from falling apart). Add more water if needed to ensure all vegetables are submerged in the broth.
A Final Pressure Simmer: Close the lid again, set the pressure cooker to high pressure, and cook for another 20 minutes.
Final Cooking: When the second 20 min elapses, open the lid and add the potatoes and cooked chickpeas and cook covered or uncovered for another 20 min without pressure. Check the done-ness of your potatoes and when these are soft your meat and vegetable broth is done. ​



The Foolproof Couscous Method:
Quick and Easy Semolina: While the vegetables finish cooking, prepare your gluten-free couscous. In a separate pot, heat the water to a boil. Add the butter, salt, and vegetable stock powder.
The Power of Absorption: Once boiling, pour in the gluten-free semolina (rice or corn) and stir well. Cover the pot, turn off the heat, and let the couscous rest for 10-15 minutes. This allows the semolina to absorb all the water and cook through. Fluff the couscous with a fork before serving.


​The Sweet and Savory Tfaya:
Caramelized Perfection: While the couscous rests, prepare the Tfaya. In a pan, heat the butter and olive oil over low heat. Add the thinly sliced onions and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent and beautifully caramelized (around 30 minutes).
Sweet and Spicy Symphony: Stir in the cinnamon powder, cinnamon sticks, salt, honey, and brown sugar. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.​​

Picture
The Grand Finale:
Presentation is Key: Now for the fun part! On a serving platter, create a bed of fluffy couscous. Make a well in the center and fill it with the flavorful meat and vegetable stew. Arrange the remaining vegetables around the well. Top with the chickpeas and the sweet and savory Tfaya.
A Feast for the Senses: Serve your Moroccan Tajine hot, inviting your guests to savor the explosion of flavors and textures.
Picture

Tips & Tricks:
Spice it Up: Adjust the spice level to your preference. Add extra chili flakes or a pinch of cayenne pepper for a bolder kick.
Leftovers Delight: This dish reheats beautifully. Store leftover couscous in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

Conclusion:
This Pressure Cooker Moroccan Couscous is a perfect example of how to enjoy the essence of a traditional dish with a modern twist. It's quick, easy, and adaptable to your dietary needs, making it a fantastic addition to your weeknight dinner repertoire. So, gather your ingredients, fire up your pressure cooker, and embark on a culinary adventure to Morocco!

​Unveiling the Secrets of Simit: A Journey Through Turkish History and Gluten-Free Baking

Legend weaves a charming tale around the Simit, adding a touch of romance to its rich history. It's said that during the Ottoman era, a baker named Mehmed fell in love with the Sultan's beautiful daughter. Knowing he could never marry her due to his social standing, Mehmed poured his love and longing into his baking. He created a new bread, shaped like a ring to symbolize unending love, and encrusted it with sesame seeds, resembling the beauty marks adorning the Sultan's daughter.

The enticing aroma of Mehmed's creation wafted through the palace, reaching the Sultan himself. Impressed by the unique bread and its captivating fragrance, the Sultan summoned Mehmed. Mehmed, both nervous and hopeful, presented his creation and narrated the story behind it. The Sultan, touched by Mehmed's love and talent, not only relished the Simit but also saw the sincerity in Mehmed's heart. Though unable to grant Mehmed his daughter's hand in marriage, the Sultan bestowed upon him a prestigious position as the royal baker. The Simit, a symbol of love and ingenuity, became a beloved treat throughout the Ottoman Empire.

Whether this story holds historical truth or not, it beautifully captures the essence of Simit. It's more than just bread; it's a cultural icon, a symbol of love, and a testament to the creativity of Turkish bakers. So, next time you bite into a Simit, remember the story of Mehmed, savor the flavors, and let yourself be transported on a delicious journey through Turkish history.

The Simit Today

​Beyond the bustling streets of Istanbul and the serene shores of the Aegean Sea lies a culinary treasure – Simit. This iconic Turkish bread, with its golden brown crown of sesame seeds and satisfyingly chewy texture, is a beloved breakfast staple and a cherished street food experience. Its origins, however, stretch back centuries, weaving a fascinating tale of culinary ingenuity and cultural exchange.

A Bread Steeped in History:
Historians trace the origins of Simit back to the Byzantine era, where a similar bread ring encrusted with sesame seeds was enjoyed. The Ottomans, known for their mastery of baking techniques, are credited with perfecting the Simit recipe during their reign. They introduced a unique dipping process in a molasses solution, adding a touch of sweetness and a distinctive flavor that sets Simit apart.

The Allure of Simit:
The charm of Simit lies not only in its taste but also in its accessibility. Found at bakeries (fırın) and street vendors (simitçi) across Turkey, Simit offers a convenient and affordable breakfast option. Its portability makes it a perfect on-the-go snack, enjoyed by students, workers, and tourists alike. The distinctive aroma of freshly baked Simit wafting through the air is a sensory experience that entices passersby and embodies the vibrant street food culture of Turkey.

Gluten-Free Magic: Recreating a Turkish Tradition:
For those following a gluten-free diet, the allure of Simit might seem out of reach. But fear not! This recipe unlocks the secrets of creating a delicious and authentic-tasting Simit using entirely gluten-free flours.​
Picture
Ingredients (for 6 medium or 8 small Simit):

Dry Ingredients:
1.5 cups Rice Flour or Millet Flour
1.5 cups Oat Flour or Sorghum Flour
1.5 cups Tapioca Starch or Potato Starch
Wet Ingredients:
1.5 tsp Instant Yeast
3 tsp Psyllium Husk Powder
1 tsp Salt
2 tsp Sugar
1 tbsp Olive Oil
2 cups Warm Water

Coating:
2 cups Sesame Seeds
3 tbsp Pomegranate or Grape Molasses
6 tbsp Water

A Step-by-Step Guide to Gluten-Free Simit Perfection:
In a large bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients: flours, yeast, psyllium husk powder, salt, and sugar.
Add your wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until a shaggy dough forms. If the dough feels too dry, add a tablespoon of water at a time until it becomes manageable but not sticky.
Lightly grease the dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place for 45 min-1h, until it doubles in size. while this is happening, preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 
On a lightly floured surface, divide the risen dough into 6-8 equal pieces, depending on your desired Simit size. For the classic Simit shape, you'll need  two small dough balls for each Simit piece as you rope them around each other.
Roll each small ball into a long snake, about 5-7 inches in length. Take the two snakes and gently braid them together, ensuring a tight and even braid. Carefully tuck the ends of the braid underneath to form a circular shape. Pinch the connection point to secure the braid. See videos below*
Feel free to experiment with different shapes! Here are a few ideas:
Long Braid: Shape the dough into a single long snake, approximately 10-12 inches in length. Braid it over itself, tucking the ends underneath to form a circular shape. This variation resembles a Challah bread shape.
Remember: Gluten-free dough can be slightly more delicate than traditional wheat dough. Handle it gently and avoid overworking it. Keep flouring your surface if it becomes a bit sticky to work with. 
Prepare a shallow dish with the water and molasses mixture. In another shallow dish, spread out the sesame seeds. Here's the signature Simit touch!
Carefully pick up a shaped Simit and gently dip it into the molasses mixture, coating it evenly on all sides. Don't soak the Simit for too long, as it can become soggy. 
Immediately transfer the Simit from the molasses bath to the sesame seeds. Gently roll it around to ensure good coverage. Press down lightly with your fingers to ensure the sesame seeds adhere well.
Arrange the Simit on your prepared baking sheet, leaving space between them for expansion during baking.
Bake the Simit for 30-40 minutes, or until they are golden brown in color. A good indicator of doneness is a hollow sound when you tap the bottom of the Simit.

​Ful Medammes: Unveiling the Vegan Powerhouse of Egyptian Cuisine

Have you ever embarked on a culinary journey that transports you to a different land with just one bite? Ful Medammes, a humble yet remarkably flavorful fava bean stew, offers just such an experience. This hearty and naturally vegan dish is a cornerstone of Egyptian cuisine, holding a cherished place in the hearts (and stomachs) of Egyptians for millennia. Its origins stretch back to ancient times, when fava beans were a staple crop and a valuable source of protein. Today, Ful Medammes transcends its historical roots, remaining a beloved breakfast staple across the Middle East and North Africa. Whether enjoyed in bustling street cafes or within the comfort of homes, this dish embodies the essence of comfort food – simple, affordable, and bursting with satisfying flavors.

Ful Medammes isn't just about taste; it's a cultural touchstone. The communal act of sharing a steaming pot of Ful Medammes with family and friends fosters a sense of connection and togetherness. The versatility of the dish allows for customization, reflecting regional preferences. Some enjoy it with a fiery kick of chili peppers, while others prefer a more subtle approach. Regardless of the variations, the essence of Ful Medammes remains – a testament to the ingenuity and resourcefulness of Egyptian cuisine.

​So, are you ready to embark on your own culinary adventure? This recipe unveils the secrets to creating an authentic and delicious Ful Medammes at home. With readily available ingredients and a straightforward process, you can recreate this timeless Egyptian dish and experience the vibrant flavors that have captivated palates for centuries.

Ingredients:
2 cans (400g each) Fava Beans, drained and rinsed
1 large Onion, diced
3 Ripe Tomatoes, diced
3 Garlic Cloves, diced
1 tablespoon Ground Cumin
Juice of 1/2 a Lemon 
1 teaspoon Paprika
Salt, to taste
Black Pepper, to taste
Extra Virgin Olive Oil
Fresh Parsley, chopped (for garnish)

Instructions:
Sauté the Base: In a large pot or cast iron skillet, heat a generous amount of olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onions and garlic cloves. Sauté for 5-7 minutes, or until the onions become softened and translucent.
Introduce the Tomatoes: Add the diced tomatoes to the pot and cook for an additional 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let the tomatoes soften and release their juices, creating a base for the stew.
Spice it Up: Stir in the ground cumin and paprika, toasting the spices for 30 seconds to release their full aroma. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
Welcome the Fava Beans: Add the drained and rinsed fava beans to the pot. Stir to combine them with the flavorful base. Reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 20-30 minutes.
Creamy Perfection: During simmering, use a potato masher or the back of a spoon to gently mash some of the fava beans. This creates a creamy texture without compromising the whole bean experience. Leave some beans unmashed for a satisfying bite variation.
Serve and Savor: Once the fava beans are tender and the stew has reached a desired consistency, remove the pot from heat and add your lemon juice. Mix and garnish with fresh chopped parsley and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Serve hot with your favorite gluten-free bread, such as my gluten free pita bread or gluten free french baguettes, for a delightful and satisfying meal.​

Tips:
Experiment with Spice: For a touch of heat, add a pinch of cayenne pepper or a chopped green chili pepper while sautéing the onions and garlic.
​Leftovers: Ful Medames stores well in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in a saucepan or microwave until warmed through.

​Enjoy the taste of tradition with Ful Medammes! This simple and delicious dish is a perfect way to experience the culinary heritage of Egypt. So gather your ingredients, follow these easy steps, and savor the unique flavors of this vegan delight.

Ready to embark on your gluten-free brioche adventure? Let's gather the ingredients!​​
Picture

Ingredients:
Dry Ingredients:
18 g Psyllium Husk
165 g Tapioca Starch
140 g Brown Rice Flour
30 g Oat Flour
30 g Brown Sugar (or other sugar of your choice)
9 g Active Dry Yeast
7 g Baking Powder
5 g Xanthan Gum
Pinch of Salt
Wet Ingredients:
200 g Warm Water
100 ml Warm Milk
1 Egg
40 g Melted Butter
Chocolate Chips (to your liking)
For Brushing:
1/3 cup Milk
1 tbsp Honey or Maple Syrup

Method:
Prepare the Base: In a medium bowl, whisk together the psyllium husk and half of the warm water (100g) to create a gel. Let this sit for 5 minutes to thicken.
Activate the Yeast: In a separate bowl, combine the remaining warm water (100g) with half of the sugar (15g) and the active dry yeast. Let this mixture sit for 5-10 minutes, or until it becomes frothy and active.
Dry Ingredients Unite: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients: tapioca starch, brown rice flour, oat flour, sugar, baking powder, xanthan gum, and salt.
Wet and Dry Harmony: Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour in the activated yeast mixture, psyllium husk gel, melted butter, egg, and milk. Using a hand mixer fitted with a dough hook or a sturdy spoon, begin mixing the wet and dry ingredients until a shaggy dough forms.
Knead for Perfection: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes. The dough should be slightly sticky but not overly so. 
Shaping the Brioche:
Form the Dough Ball: Shape the kneaded dough into a smooth ball. Place it in a clean bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
Chocolate Chip Love: Once the dough has risen, gently deflate it on a lightly floured surface. Add your desired amount of chocolate chips and knead them gently into the dough until evenly distributed.
Shaping the Buns: Divide the dough into 10 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a smooth ball. Using your palms, gently flatten each ball into a disc. Fold the disc in half, then pinch the seam closed to create a crescent shape. Roll the crescent shape into a small log, shaping it into a classic brioche bun. Repeat with the remaining dough pieces.
Second Rise: Place the shaped brioche buns on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving space between them for rising. Cover the buns loosely with plastic wrap and let them rise for an additional 30 minutes in a warm place.
Baking to Golden Perfection:
Preheat the Oven: While the brioche buns are undergoing their second rise, preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). 
Glaze for Shine: In a small bowl, whisk together the milk and honey (or maple syrup) to create a simple glaze. This will add a beautiful shine and a touch of sweetness to the finished brioche.
Brush for Beauty: Once the brioche buns have doubled in size during their second rise, gently brush the tops with the prepared milk glaze.
Bake to Perfection: Place the baking sheet with the brioche buns in the preheated oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the buns are golden brown on top and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.
Melted Butter Bliss: As soon as you remove the brioche buns from the oven, brush them again with melted butter for an extra touch of richness and a softer finish.
Cool Slightly and Enjoy!: These are best enjoyed warm or at room temperature.


Storage and Reheating
Store leftover brioche buns in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, freeze them in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Reheat individual brioche buns in the microwave for a few seconds, or until warmed through.

Moroccan Zucchini and Zaatar Tajine with delicious "daghmira"

​A Culinary Journey to Morocco: Zucchini Zaatar Tajine with Daghmira

Embark on a flavor adventure to Morocco with this delectable Zucchini Zaatar Tajine! This traditional one-pot dish features succulent lamb or beef nestled in a fragrant broth, alongside tender zucchini and a rich "daghmira" sauce. The magic lies in the slow simmering within a tajine, a beautiful earthenware pot that infuses the dish with aromatic spices and tenderizes the ingredients to perfection.

What is a Tajine? A tajine is a conical-shaped pot with a flat base and a tall, pointed lid. This unique design creates a steam circulation system, allowing the food to cook evenly in its own juices, resulting in incredibly flavorful and tender results.

This comforting tajine is a celebration of Moroccan flavors. The savory combination of lamb or beef, fragrant spices like ginger and turmeric, and the vibrant zaatar herb blend creates a symphony of taste. "Daghmira" refers to the rich sauce that forms during the cooking process, adding depth and complexity to every bite.

​In Moroccan cuisine, daghmira (pronounced dagh-MEE-ra) is more than just a sauce; it's a culinary cornerstone. Daghmira refers to the rich, flavorful liquid that forms at the bottom of a tagine or pot after slow-cooking meat and vegetables. Traditionally made by caramelizing onions, adding tomatoes (sometimes), and simmering with an array of spices like ginger, turmeric, and saffron, daghmira transforms the simple cooking broth into a luxurious sauce. This flavorful base not only adds depth and complexity to every bite, but it also acts as a tenderizer, ensuring the meat becomes melt-in-your-mouth delicious. So, next time you encounter a Moroccan dish boasting a rich, savory sauce, remember, it's likely the magic of daghmira at play!

Ready to embark on this culinary adventure? Let's gather the ingredients!

Ingredients:
500 g Lamb or Beef Chunks
2 Onions or Leeks (finely chopped)
2 Garlic Cloves (grated, optional for low-FODMAP)
1-2 Zucchini, Cut into Short Rectangles
3-4 Tbsp Olive Oil
1 tsp Ginger Powder
1 tsp Turmeric Powder
5-10 Saffron Threads, Steeped in Hot Water
Place the saffron threads in a small bowl.
Pour a few tablespoons of hot water over the saffron.
Let the saffron steep for 10 minutes, allowing it to release its vibrant color and flavor.
Handful of Parsley and Cilantro, Tied Together with Food-Grade Rope
Salt and Pepper, to Taste
1/2 Tbsp Dried Oregano

Method:
Embrace the Aromatics: In a cast iron skillet or tajine pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions or leeks, ginger powder, and turmeric powder. Sauté until the onions become translucent and softened, about 5 minutes.
Browning the Base: Add the lamb or beef chunks to the pot and brown them on all sides.
Unlocking the Saffron's Magic: Pour in the saffron water along with enough water to just cover the meat. Add the herb bouquet garni and bring to a simmer. Cover the pot and let the meat simmer for 15-20 minutes.
Turning the Tables: Carefully check on the meat and flip the pieces to ensure even browning. Simmer for an additional 10 minutes.
Low and Slow: Pour in 1 cup of water, cover the pot, and reduce the heat to low-medium. Let the tajine simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the meat is fork-tender.
Introducing the Star: Once the meat is cooked, remove it from the pot and set it aside. Add the zucchini to the remaining sauce (daghmira). Simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the zucchini is tender.
Adjusting the Consistency: If the sauce seems too thick, add an additional 1/3 to 1/2 cup of water.​
Reuniting the Stars: Return the cooked meat to the pot with the zucchini and sauce. Cover the tajine and simmer for an additional 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld beautifully.
The Finishing Touch: Remove the tajine from the heat. Discard the herb bouquet garni. Sprinkle the dried oregano over the top of the dish, adding a touch of aromatic flair.

Serve and Savor: Enjoy your Zucchini Zaatar Tajine with daghmira alongside my gluten-free flatbread or any bread of your choice. Immerse yourself in the vibrant flavors of Morocco and savor the culinary adventure!


Tips:
Leftovers Delight: This tajine reheats beautifully. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop, adding a splash of water if needed to maintain the sauce consistency.

This Zucchini Zaatar Tajine with Daghmira is a feast for the senses, offering a taste of Moroccan culinary tradition. With its tender meat, vibrant vegetables, and flavorful sauce, this dish is sure to become a favorite in your kitchen. So, gather your ingredients, fire up your tajine, and embark on a delicious journey!

Culinary Masterpiece: The Scalloped Potato and Beef Pinwheel Roll

Prepare to impress your taste buds with a dish that's as visually stunning as it is delicious! The Scalloped Potato and Beef Pinwheel Roll is a culinary masterpiece waiting to happen. Imagine a spiral of thinly sliced potatoes, baked to tender perfection, encasing a savory ground beef filling, all rolled up into a beautiful log and baked to golden perfection.

Perfect for a weeknight dinner or a potluck showstopper, this recipe is surprisingly easy to make. It's a guaranteed crowd-pleaser for anyone who loves comfort food with a touch of elegance. This recipe also offers flexibility! You can easily adjust the spices in the filling to suit your taste, or add other vegetables for extra flavor and texture.

Let's get rolling!

Ingredients:

For the Potato Layer:
3-4 russet potatoes, peeled
Salt, to taste
200-250 grams grated mozzarella cheese 
50 g sliced provolone cheese for the filling (optional) ​

For the Ground Beef Filling:
500 grams ground beef
2 teaspoons paprika
2 teaspoons ginger powder
2 teaspoons oregano
2 teaspoons cumin powder
2 teaspoons cinnamon powder
2 teaspoons garlic powder (optional)
2 tablespoons tomato concentrate
Salt, to taste
1 teaspoon pepper (optional)
3 diced bell peppers (green and red)
2 chopped onions
Olive oil

Additional:
Baking paper

Instructions:
Crafting the Filling: In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and bell peppers and cook until softened, about 10 minutes.
Savory Ground Beef: Crumble the ground beef into the pan and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon. Stir in the paprika, ginger powder, oregano, cumin powder, cinnamon powder, and garlic powder (if using). Cook for another minute, allowing the spices to release their aroma.
Flavorful Finish: Add the tomato concentrate and season with salt and pepper (to taste). Simmer for 15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Remove the pan from the heat and set the filling aside.
Potato Shingles: Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with baking paper. Using a sharp knife or mandolin, thinly slice the peeled potatoes (⅛-inch or 3 mm thick).
Cheese Base: Spread the grated mozzarella cheese evenly over the prepared baking sheet, creating a thin, even layer.
Building the Scallops: Arrange the sliced potatoes in a single, overlapping layer on top of the cheese. Make sure the potato slices are snug together with minimal gaps. Season with salt.
Bake the Base: Bake the potato and cheese layer for 20-25 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and slightly golden brown around the edges.
Building the Pinwheel: Once cooked, carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven. 
Filling Time: Spread the cooked ground beef filling evenly over the top of the potato layer. Optional: Sprinkle with additional grated cheese at this point for extra cheesy goodness.
The Big Roll: Using the baking paper as an aid, carefully begin to roll the potato and cheese layer with the filling inside, like a jelly roll. Use the parchment paper to guide you and ensure a tight roll. ​​

Final Bake: Carefully transfer the rolled pinwheel (seam side down) to a clean baking sheet. Bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese on top is golden brown and crispy.
Rest and Slice: Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the pinwheel rest for 10 minutes before slicing. This allows the flavors to continue to develop and ensures the potatoes are set. Use a sharp knife to carefully slice the pinwheel into pinwheel-shaped slices.

Serve and Enjoy! Serve the Scalloped Potato and Beef Pinwheel Roll warm, alongside your favorite dipping sauce or gravy, if desired.

Tips:
Spice it Up! Feel free to adjust the spices in the ground beef filling to your liking. For example, you could add a pinch of cayenne pepper for a touch of heat, or a teaspoon of dried thyme for a more herbal flavor.
Vegetable Variations: Don't be afraid to experiment with different vegetables in the filling! Chopped mushrooms, carrots, or zucchini would all be delicious additions.
Leftovers: This Scalloped Potato and Beef Pinwheel Roll reheats well. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven at 375°F (190°C) until warmed through.

​This recipe is a fantastic way to elevate the classic comfort food of scalloped potatoes and ground beef. The pinwheel presentation adds a touch of elegance, making it perfect for a special occasion or a casual weeknight dinner.

Gluten Free Rustic Italian Olive Bread

​Close Your Eyes and Imagine This: Sun-Drenched Italian Countryside...Imagine yourself standing in a sun-drenched Italian piazza, the aroma of fresh bread wafting from a charming bakery. You peek inside, mesmerized by the rows of golden loaves, their crusts crackling with a satisfying crunch. One, in particular, catches your eye: a rustic beauty studded with plump green olives, promising a symphony of flavors.

This, my friend, is the magic you can recreate in your own kitchen with this Gluten-Free Rustic Italian Olive Breadloaf recipe! Perfect for those who crave the authentic Italian bread experience but follow a gluten-free lifestyle, this recipe delivers on taste and texture.

But wait, there's more! This versatile bread is a true culinary chameleon. Toast it for a simple yet satisfying breakfast or afternoon snack, slather it with creamy ricotta and fresh tomatoes for a light and elegant lunch, or unleash your creativity and use it for sandwiches with your favorite meats and cheeses. Whether you're a gluten-free veteran or just dipping your toes into the world of alternative flours, this recipe is designed for success.

Here are some insider tips to ensure your bread turns out picture-perfect:
Freshness is Key: For the best results, use fresh, high-quality flours. If possible, opt for freshly ground brown rice flour and oat flour, which will add a delightful nutty depth of flavor to your bread.
Activate Your Yeast: This recipe relies on active dry yeast, and ensuring it's properly activated is crucial for a good rise. Warm the water to around 105°F (40°C) and follow the instructions for creating a foamy yeast mixture. This indicates the yeast is alive and ready to work its magic.
Psyllium Power: Psyllium husk acts as a binder in gluten-free baking, mimicking the elasticity of gluten. Don't skip the step of creating the psyllium gel by letting it sit for a few minutes. This allows it to thicken properly and bind the dough effectively.
The Art of Kneading: While this dough doesn't require the same intense kneading as traditional bread, taking a few minutes to knead it by hand or with a stand mixer will develop its texture and elasticity. You'll know it's ready when it becomes smooth and slightly elastic.
Embrace the Steam: The initial baking phase with steam in a hot cast iron skillet is a game-changer! This creates a wonderful crust and helps the bread rise beautifully.
The Hollow Sound Test: Wondering if your bread is done? Once the baking time is nearly complete, tap the bottom of the loaf. A hollow sound indicates it's cooked through.

​With these tips and tricks in your arsenal, you're ready to embark on this delicious gluten-free adventure! So, grab your ingredients, preheat your oven, and get ready to bake a breadloaf that's as beautiful as it is delicious.
Picture
Ingredients:
110 g brown rice flour
125 g tapioca or potato starch
100 g oat flour
400 g warm water (around 105°F / 40°C)
22 g psyllium husk
20 g sugar
10 g active dry yeast
10 g salt
12 g apple cider vinegar
120 g chopped green, black, or mixed olives (of your choice)

Detailed Method:
Prepare the Psyllium Gel: In a small bowl, whisk together 22 g psyllium husk with 200 g (half) of the warm water. Let this mixture sit for 5-10 minutes, until it thickens into a gel-like consistency.
Activate the Yeast: In another small bowl, combine 10 g of the sugar with a tablespoon of the warm water (remaining half). Sprinkle the active dry yeast (10 g) over the top and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. The yeast should become foamy, indicating it's active.
Combine Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients: brown rice flour (110 g), tapioca or potato starch (125 g), oat flour (100 g), and salt (10 g).
Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients: Add the psyllium gel, activated yeast mixture, apple cider vinegar (12 g), and the remaining 200 g of warm water to the dry ingredients. Using a sturdy spoon or a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix everything together until a rough dough forms.
Knead the Dough: Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic. You might need to add a little extra flour if the dough feels too sticky.
Incorporate the Olives: Flatten the dough with your hands on the floured surface. Scatter the chopped olives (120 g) evenly over the dough. Gently fold the dough over itself, incorporating the olives within. Knead the dough for another minute or two, just until the olives are evenly distributed.
Shape the Dough: Lightly oil your hands to prevent sticking. Shape the dough into a smooth ball. This might require gentle stretching and folding of the dough to achieve a round shape.
First Rise: Place the dough ball in a floured basket or a small bowl lined with a clean, flour-dusted kitchen towel. Cover the bowl or basket with cling film. Let the dough rise in a warm spot for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
Preheat the Oven and Skillet: While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 480°F (249°C). Place a cast iron skillet or oven-safe baking dish inside the preheating oven to get it hot.
Second Rise and Score the Dough: Once the dough has doubled in size, gently remove it from the bowl or basket. Place it on a lightly floured surface. Using a sharp knife, score the top of the dough with a few diagonal cuts. This allows for even steam release and a rustic look.
Baking with Steam: Carefully remove the hot cast iron skillet from the oven and place the dough ball (on a piece of parchment paper) inside the skillet. Here's the trick for extra steam: Add a few ice cubes between the parchment paper and the bottom of the skillet. The ice will create steam during the initial baking phase, which will contribute to a nice crust.
Bake with Steam (continued): Place the skillet with the dough and parchment paper back into the preheated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes with the steam. This initial baking with steam helps create a good rise and crust development.
Reduce Heat and Continue Baking: After the initial 15-20 minutes of baking with steam, reduce the oven temperature to 425°F (218°C) and continue baking for another 45-50 minutes.
Checking for Doneness: The bread is done when it has a beautiful golden brown crust on the outside. You can also tap the bottom of the loaf – if it sounds hollow, it's a good indication that the bread is cooked through.
Cooling and Enjoying: Once baked, remove the bread from the oven and transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Resist the urge to slice into it right away! Letting the bread cool allows it to set properly and ensures a better texture.​


Serving Suggestions:
Toast with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt for a simple breakfast or snack.
Serve alongside a hearty soup or salad for a satisfying lunch or dinner.
Use it for sandwiches with your favorite meats, cheeses, and vegetables.
Top with a sweet spread like jam or honey for a delightful treat.

Storage: Store leftover bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. You can also slice and freeze the bread for longer storage. To reheat, simply toast slices in a toaster or oven. 

Let the aroma of this freshly baked Gluten-Free Rustic Italian Olive Breadloaf fill your kitchen and enjoy a taste of Italy without the gluten!

Happy Baking!

Gluten-Free, One-Bowl Carrot Cake Energy Bars: Guilt-Free Indulgence with Every Bite!

Craving a delicious and healthy snack that tastes like a decadent carrot cake but fits your active lifestyle? Look no further than these Gluten-Free, One-Bowl Carrot Cake Energy Bars! Packed with wholesome ingredients like carrots, nuts, seeds, and a touch of natural sweetness, these bars offer a satisfying crunch and a burst of flavor in every bite. The beauty of this recipe lies in its simplicity. Made in just one bowl and requiring minimal prep, it's perfect for busy mornings, after-school cravings, or a pre-workout boost.

But wait, there's more! These bars aren't just a delicious treat; they're also loaded with nutritional benefits. The carrots provide a source of beta-carotene, while the nuts and seeds offer healthy fats, fiber, and protein. The natural sweeteners, like honey or date syrup, provide a touch of sweetness without the guilt.

Ready to ditch the store-bought energy bars and whip up a batch of these homemade delights? Let's get baking!

Here's what you'll need (makes approximately 12 bars):
2 Carrots: Shredded for a delicious carrot cake flavor and added moisture.
Flax Egg (or Chia Egg): A vegan substitute for a regular egg. To make a flax egg, simply combine 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed with 3 tablespoons of water. Let it sit for 5 minutes until thickened. Chia eggs can be made the same way, using chia seeds instead of flaxseed.
1 Cup Oats: Rolled oats provide a base for the bars and add a satisfying texture. Opt for certified gluten-free oats if you have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.
1 tsp Cinnamon Powder: Warm and inviting, cinnamon adds a classic carrot cake spice.
1/2 cup Shredded Coconut (or Desiccated Coconut): Adds a touch of sweetness and a delightful textural contrast.
1 tsp Salt: Enhances the overall flavor profile.
1 cup Nuts of Your Choice: Pecans, almonds, walnuts – choose your favorites or mix and match for added variety. Roughly chop the nuts for a chunky texture.
1/3 cup Seeds of Your Choice: Pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, chia seeds – these add healthy fats, protein, and a satisfying crunch.
1/2 cup Almond Flour (or Hazelnut Flour): Provides a gluten-free flour base and adds a subtle nutty flavor.
2 tbsp Maple Syrup (or Honey or Date Syrup): Natural sweeteners that bind the ingredients and add a touch of sweetness. Choose your preferred option based on taste and dietary needs.
1/2 cup Date Paste: Made from pressed dates, it offers a concentrated sweetness and helps bind the bars together. If you can't find date paste at the store, you can easily make your own! Simply soak 1 cup of pitted dates in hot water for 10 minutes. Drain the water and blend the dates in a food processor until you get a smooth paste.

Now, let's get baking!
Shred the Carrots: Using a food processor or a grater, shred the carrots until they resemble finely grated cheese. Set them aside.
Pulse the Dry Ingredients: In your food processor, add the oats, nuts, seeds, cinnamon powder, and salt. Pulse a few times until the nuts are chopped and the mixture has a coarse consistency with some texture. You can adjust the pulsing time based on your preference for chunkier or smoother bars.
Combine Everything: In a large bowl, add the shredded carrots, the pulsed dry ingredients from the food processor, almond flour, maple syrup or your chosen sweetener, date paste, and the flax or chia egg.
Mix it Up!: Using your hands, mix everything together thoroughly until a compact dough forms. The mixture should hold its shape when pressed and not be crumbly.
Prep the Baking Pan: Line a 9x9 inch square baking tray with parchment paper. This will make it easier to remove the bars later.
Press and Bake: Spread the dough evenly into the prepared baking pan, pressing it down firmly with your hands or a spatula to ensure a compact and even consistency. Bake the bars at 350°F (175°C) for 25-30 minutes, or until they are lightly golden brown.
Cool Completely: Let the bars cool completely in the pan before cutting them. This allows them to set properly.
Chocolate Drizzle (Optional): Once the bars are cool, you can elevate their decadence with a touch of chocolate! Melt some dark chocolate, milk chocolate, or white chocolate (depending on your preference) in a double boiler or in the microwave using short bursts with stirring in between. Once melted and smooth, drizzle the chocolate over the cooled bars in a zig-zag pattern or create any design you like. Allow the chocolate to set completely before cutting and serving.​

This isn't just a dream; it's the enchanting reality of the Fraisier cake, a French masterpiece that translates beautifully to a gluten-free world. The Fraisier, also known as a strawberry shortcake, is a celebration of simplicity and pure flavor. Its origins trace back to 19th century France, where it quickly became a favorite for its light and refreshing profile. Traditionally, the cake layers are made with all-purpose flour, but for our gluten-free friends and those seeking a lighter option, this recipe takes a delightful turn.

The secret to a perfect Fraisier lies in the aerated sponge cake. Unlike its traditional counterpart, this version uses a symphony of gluten-free flours. Rice flour provides a light and slightly nutty base, while tapioca or potato starch adds structure without the heaviness of wheat flour. Finally, xanthan gum plays a crucial role. This magic ingredient mimics the elasticity of gluten, resulting in a cake that's both fluffy and tender.

But the magic doesn't stop there. The true heart of the Fraisier lies in the macerated strawberries. This French technique involves gently softening fresh berries in a mixture of sugar and sometimes a touch of lemon juice. This process not only intensifies the vibrant strawberry flavor but also creates a delightful syrup. This syrup, with its concentrated sweetness and vibrant color, becomes a double agent – brushed onto the cake layers for added moisture and used as a decorative drizzle for a finishing touch.

Finally, the whipped cream adds a touch of pure indulgence. However, to ensure it maintains its shape and doesn't weep (separate), we turn to the secret weapon – cream cheese. This creamy addition not only adds a subtle tang but also stabilizes the whipped cream, ensuring a beautiful cake that holds its form perfectly.
So, are you ready to embark on this flavor journey? This recipe unveils all the secrets to creating an unforgettable Gluten-Free Fraisier, a dessert that's not only gluten-free but also a symphony of textures and taste. Get ready to impress your guests with a showstopper that will leave them wanting more!

Picture
Ingredients:
For the Vanilla Sponges (makes 2 - 6-inch cakes):
80 g rice flour
50 g tapioca or potato starch
30 g corn flour
30 g almond flour or hazelnut flour
160 g brown sugar or cane sugar
1 ½ tsp baking powder
½ tsp salt
⅓ tsp xanthan gum
90 g softened butter
1 large egg
145 g milk, room temperature
1 tbsp vanilla extract

For the Macerated Strawberries:
300 g fresh strawberries, sliced
1 tsp vanilla extract
40 g cane sugar or brown sugar
1 tbsp lemon juice

For the Cream:
250 g heavy whipping cream (lactose-free if needed)
100 g cream cheese, cold
60 g icing sugar or powdered sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract

Instructions:

Make the Strawberries:
Macerate the Strawberries: Combine the sliced strawberries, sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or ideally overnight.
Prepare the Strawberry Syrup (Optional): Strain the macerated strawberries, reserving the juice. In a small saucepan over medium heat, reduce the strawberry juice until it reaches a syrupy consistency. Allow to cool completely.
Make the Vanilla Sponges:
Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly grease two 6-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Alternatively, you can use one larger cake pan (around 8-inch) but adjust the baking time accordingly.
Prep the Cake Pans: Lightly grease two 6-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Alternatively, you can use one larger cake pan (around 8-inch) but remember to adjust the baking time accordingly.
Combine Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients: rice flour, tapioca/potato starch, corn flour, almond flour (or hazelnut flour), sugar, baking powder, salt, and xanthan gum. This ensures even distribution of the dry ingredients throughout the batter.
Work the Butter: Using a hand mixer on low speed (or your hands if you prefer), gradually work the softened butter into the dry ingredients until you get a crumbly mixture that resembles breadcrumbs. This method ensures the butter doesn't over-cream and keeps the cake light and airy.
Wet Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, and vanilla extract.
Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients: Gradually add the wet ingredients (egg, milk, and vanilla mixture) to the dry ingredients in the large bowl. Mix until just combined and no lumps are left, being careful not to overmix. Overmixing can lead to a dense cake.
Fill and Bake: Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool completely on a wire rack before assembling.
​Make the Cream:
Whip the Cream: In a chilled bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. In a separate bowl, beat together the cold cream cheese, icing sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth. Gently fold the cream cheese mixture into the whipped cream until just combined.
​Assemble your Cake:
Cool Completely: Ensure your cake layers are completely cool before assembling. This prevents the whipped cream from melting and keeps the cake layers stable.
Level Up (Optional): For a perfectly even canvas, you can gently trim off any uneven edges from the cake layers using a serrated knife. This step isn't essential but creates a more polished look.
Brush with Flavor (Optional): If you made the optional strawberry syrup from the macerated strawberries, brush one cake layer lightly with the syrup. This adds a touch of extra moisture and intensifies the strawberry flavor in each bite.
Creamy Canvas: Pipe or spread a generous layer of whipped cream over the moistened cake layer. Use a piping bag fitted with a large round tip for a professional look, or simply spread it evenly with a spatula.
Berry Bounty: Arrange half of your macerated strawberries on top of the whipped cream layer. Gently press them down slightly to ensure they stay put.
Second Story: Carefully place the second cake layer on top of the first layer, creating a sandwich with the whipped cream and strawberries nestled in between.
Frosting Finale: Now, repeat the magic! Pipe or spread another layer of whipped cream over the top cake layer, ensuring it's fully coated.
Strawberry Spectacle: Here comes the fun part! Decorate the top and sides of the cake with more strawberries. You can arrange them in a beautiful pattern, create a cascading effect, or simply scatter them artistically.

Serve and Enjoy!


​Tips and Storage:
For a richer flavor profile: Toast the almond or hazelnut flour before adding it to the dry ingredients. Spread the flour on a baking sheet and toast in a preheated oven at 300°F (150°C) for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden brown.
Troubleshooting: If your cake layers seem too crumbly, you may have overmixed the batter. Be gentle when folding in the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients.
Storage: Store leftover Fraisier cake in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The cake will soften slightly as it sits, but the flavors will continue to develop.

Enjoy this delightful Gluten-Free Fraisier cake! It's a perfect dessert for any occasion, offering a delicious combination of fluffy sponge cake, creamy filling, and fresh, vibrant strawberries.

Feel free to experiment! You can substitute different types of berries for the strawberries, or add a layer of fruit jam for an extra burst of flavor. With its beautiful presentation and irresistible taste, this gluten-free Fraisier is sure to impress your guests!

​Unveiling Baba Ganoush: A Smoky Delight from Lebanon (Low-FODMAP Option Included!)

Baba Ganoush, a cornerstone of Lebanese cuisine, is a symphony of smoky-roasted eggplant, creamy tahini, and vibrant lemon. This dip boasts a unique texture, offering a delightful mix of smooth and slightly chunky. Today, we'll guide you through creating this culinary masterpiece, along with a delicious accompaniment – homemade pita chips (see the recipe of my Pita Bread)!

This recipe also caters to those following a low-FODMAP diet. We'll provide a simple substitution for the garlic, allowing you to enjoy the full flavor of Baba Ganoush without digestive discomfort.

Ingredients:
For the Baba Ganoush:
2 large eggplants
¼ cup tahini (store-bought or see recipe below for homemade option)
2-3 tablespoons lemon juice (adjust based on your preference, start with less)
2-3 garlic cloves, OR ¼ cup low-FODMAP garlic oil (see instructions below)
1 teaspoon salt

For the Optional Crispy Pita Chips:
Leftover pita bread (see my gluten-free pita bread recipe if needed)
Olive oil (or low-FODMAP garlic oil)
Black and white sesame seeds
1 teaspoon paprika or smoked paprika
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon garlic powder (optional)

​The Art of Roasting Eggplant:
Roasting is key to achieving the signature smoky flavor of Baba Ganoush. Here's how to roast your eggplants to perfection:
Preheat the Oven: Set your oven to 400°F (200°C).
Prep the Eggplants: Wash and dry the eggplants. Using a fork, pierce the skin all over to allow steam to escape during roasting.
Roasting Time: Place the whole eggplants directly on a baking sheet. Roast for 45-60 minutes, or until the eggplants feel tender when squeezed gently.
Letting Off Steam: Once roasted, remove the eggplants from the oven and let them cool slightly for about 15 minutes. This allows the steam to release and makes peeling easier.

Creating the Baba Ganoush:
Peeling the Eggplant: Once cool enough to handle, cut the eggplants in half lengthwise. Scoop out the roasted flesh with a spoon, discarding the skin.
Food Processor Magic: Place the roasted eggplant flesh, tahini, lemon juice, olive oil (or low-FODMAP garlic oil – see recipe below), salt, and optional garlic powder (for those not following a low-FODMAP diet) into a food processor.
Blend to Perfection: Blend until you achieve a creamy consistency with some texture remaining. The smoothness is a matter of preference.
Taste and Adjust: Season with additional lemon juice or salt to your liking.​


Low-FODMAP Garlic Oil (Quick Version):
Heat it Up: In a small saucepan, gently heat ¼ cup of olive oil over low heat.
Infuse, Don't Fry: Add 1-2 cloves of garlic, smashed, ensuring they don't brown. Let the garlic simmer in the oil for 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to infuse without browning. Browning can introduce bitterness.
Strain and Store: Remove the garlic cloves from the oil using a slotted spoon. Store the infused oil in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.

Crispy Pita Chips:
Pita Prep: Cut your leftover pita bread into triangles or wedges.
Spice Up the Oil: In a bowl, combine olive oil (or low-FODMAP garlic oil), paprika, salt, sesame seeds, and optional garlic powder (for those not following a low-FODMAP diet).
Brush and Bake: Arrange the pita triangles on a baking sheet. Using a pastry brush, coat each triangle generously with the spiced oil mixture.
Golden Goodness: Bake the pita chips in a preheated oven at 425°F (220°C) for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy. Keep an eye on them to avoid burning.

If you can't find Tahini, here is how to make it:

Homemade Tahini Option:
Spread 1 cup sesame seeds on a baking sheet in a single layer. Toast them in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 7-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden brown and fragrant. Alternatively, you can toasted them on the stovetop by adding them to a pan or skillet but keep an eye on them as they can burn quickly!
Once toasted and cooled slightly, transfer the sesame seeds to your high-powered blender or food processor. Blend for several minutes, scraping down the sides as needed, until a smooth, runny paste forms.
Store your homemade tahini in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

Make-Ahead Tips for Baba Ganoush:
The beauty of Baba Ganoush is that it tastes even better when made ahead of time! Blend and store your Baba Ganoush in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The flavors will develop and intensify as it chills.

Serving and Storage:
Enjoy your Baba Ganoush cold with warm pita chips, fresh vegetables, or crackers. Leftover Baba Ganoush.
