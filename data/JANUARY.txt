Imagine sinking your teeth into a masterpiece of texture ‚Äì a light and airy crumb cradled by a satisfyingly crisp crust.

Experiment with brown rice, millet, or sorghum to find your perfect flavor profile. Each flour adds a subtle note, creating a symphony of texture and taste on your palate. But what truly elevates this focaccia to greatness is its adaptability. Forget boring, single-note toppings! Embrace the classic green olives for a burst of briny flavor, or create a Mediterranean masterpiece with the addition of juicy cherry tomatoes. Let your creativity run wild! Roasted vegetables, fragrant herbs, or even a drizzle of balsamic glaze - the possibilities are endless.

Focaccia isn't just a bread; it's a culinary journey through Italian tradition. While pizza may often steal the spotlight, focaccia boasts a rich heritage as a cherished Italian favorite. This recipe allows you to experience this tradition with a delightful gluten-free twist. Gluten-free doesn't have to mean flavorless, and this focaccia recipe is a revelation.

Ready to embark on this culinary adventure? Let's get baking!

Ingredients:

For the Dough (High in Protein and Fiber):
1 tablespoon (13g) whole psyllium husk (promotes a springy texture)
2.5 teaspoons (7g) active dry yeast (ensures proper rise)
1/2 cup (100g) warm filtered water (activates yeast)
1 tablespoon (20g) cane/brown sugar or honey (feeds the yeast)
1 and 1/8 cups (270g) warm filtered water
1/3 cup (80g) starch of your choice (potato, tapioca, arrowroot, cornstarch) (improves texture)
1 and 1/2 cups (220g) gluten-free whole grain flour blend (brown rice, millet, sorghum) (adds fiber and flavor)
1.5 teaspoons (10g) salt (balances flavor)
Extra virgin olive oil (for richness and moisture)

For the Customizable Toppings:
Option 1: Classic Green Olive:
1/2 cup chopped green olives (briny and flavorful)
Option 2: Mediterranean Delight:
1/2 cup chopped green olives
1/2 cup cherry tomatoes (sweet and juicy)
Instructions:
Activate the Yeast: In a small bowl, combine the yeast, sweetener, and warm water. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until bubbly. (40¬∞C or 104¬∞F is ideal water temperature for optimal yeast activation.)
Thicken the Psyllium: In a separate bowl, whisk the psyllium husk with the remaining warm water. Let it thicken into a gel-like consistency.
Combine Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the starch and gluten-free flour blend with the salt.
Form the Dough: Add the activated yeast mixture, thickened psyllium gel, and a generous amount of olive oil to the dry ingredients. Using a stand mixer or your hands, knead until a smooth, slightly sticky dough forms.
Rise and Preheat: Grease a cast iron skillet or baking pan (9x9 inch) with olive oil. Transfer the dough to the pan and press it evenly. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 425¬∞F (220¬∞C).
Dimple and Top: Drizzle the risen dough with olive oil and use your fingertips to gently create dimples in the surface. Choose your desired topping(s) from the options above and press them gently into the dough.
Bake to Golden Perfection: Bake the focaccia for 30-35 minutes, or until golden brown around the edges.
Cool and Enjoy: Remove the focaccia from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 5-10 minutes. Transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. This allows the bottom crust to crisp up and prevents sogginess.
Tips:
Experiment with Toppings: Feel free to get creative with your toppings! Roasted vegetables, herbs, and cheeses are all fantastic options.
Storage: Store leftover focaccia in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. You can also refresh it in a preheated oven (350¬∞F/175¬∞C) for a few minutes. Freeze leftover focaccia for longer storage.
Cast Iron Magic: I opted for baking this focaccia in a cast iron skillet for a reason! Cast iron boasts superior heat retention and distribution. This translates to a beautifully crisp bottom crust and a fluffy, even bake throughout the focaccia.
Alternative Baking Pan:‚Äã If you don't have a cast iron skillet, a regular baking pan will still work. However, for an extra boost of crusty goodness, preheat the baking pan in the oven for 10-15 minutes before adding the dough. This preheating step helps mimic the heat retention of cast iron and encourages a crispier bottom crust.

Buon Appetito!

- **Freezing:** To extend their shelf life, freeze the rolls individually or as a batch. Thaw and reheat whenever you crave the comforting taste of these gluten-free delights.

**Ingredients:**

- 160 g (1 1/3 cups) tapioca starch (or other starch of choice)
- 130 g (3/4 cup) brown rice flour
- 25 g (3 tbsp) oat flour
- 5 g (1 tsp) xanthan gum
- 5 g (1 tsp) salt
- 9 g (2 tsp) baking powder

The final dough be soft but not too sticky to the touch. Avoid adding more flour as it will dry as it sits and you will shape the baguettes using some brown rice flour anyways. 
Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into three equal portions  and set aside. 
before shaping the baguettes prepare a clean kitchen towel by dusting it with some flour and creating folds so as to make space for three baguettes (see picture above). 

*Shaping the Baguettes:*
Work on a lightly floured surface. Pat a piece of dough into a small rectangle. Fold the dough over itself like you are rolling cinnamon rolls, into a log. Pinch the dough together to seal.
Roll the dough back and forth to reach your desired length for each baguette. Repeat with the other two portions of dough.

*Proofing the Baguettes:*
Place the baguettes, seam-side up, into a floured kitchen towel. Cover with plastic wrap and proof for 45 minutes or until doubled in size.




*Oven Setup & Pre-heating:*
While the baguettes are proofing place a baking stone or baking sheet on the middle oven rack. Preheat the oven with the baking stone or tray inside 480¬∫F (250¬∫C) for at least 45 minutes.

*Scoring the Baguettes:*
Transfer the risen baguettes to parchment paper. Do this carefully not to deflate them. Score each baguette with 4-5 slashes. To do to this, position the bread lame or knife at about a 45-degree angle to the surface of the dough. Make relatively shallow cuts, usually around 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep. Deeper cuts allow the dough to expand more freely.

*Baking the Baguettes:*
Slide the baguettes onto the hot baking stone or sheet. Place cold water in a baking pan and place it  into the bottom rack of the oven and close the oven door. Bake at 480¬∫F (250¬∫C) for 10-12 minutes. The cold water will create steam which helps create a moist environment in the oven, particularly during the initial stages of baking. This moisture on the surface of the dough prevents the crust from setting too early. A delayed crust formation allows the bread to expand more freely in the oven, resulting in a lighter and airier texture.
After 10-12 min, open the oven door, remove the baking pan with water, reduce the oven temperature to 425¬∫F (220¬∫C), and bake for another 15-20 minutes.
If you do not see much browning on your baguettes consider broiling them for the last 5 min of their cooking time. 
Cool before cutting.

Enjoy your freshly baked gluten-free French baguettes!

Medjool Dates: A Touch of Luxury
For this recipe, we've chosen the exquisite Medjool date, known for its rich sweetness and caramel-like flavor. Often hailed as the "king of dates," Medjool dates have a rich and fascinating history deeply rooted in ancient Middle Eastern and North African cultures. Native to Morocco, Medjool dates have been cultivated for centuries in the arid regions around the city of Marrakech. Over time, the cultivation of Medjool dates spread to other regions with suitable climates, including the Coachella Valley in California, where they have been grown since the early 20th century. The journey of Medjool dates from the ancient oases of Morocco to becoming a global delicacy reflects the enduring allure of these sweet treasures and their timeless appeal across different cultures and continents.

Get Creative with Fillings!
Feel free to explore your taste preferences with the filling! Here are some ideas:
Classic Date Paste: This recipe offers a delicious baseline, but you can adjust the sweetness with the amount of added syrup or nut butter.
Fruity Twist: Swap the dates for apricot or fig jam for a delightful change of pace. Opt for sugar-free jams if desired.
Chocolate and Nut Dream: Add a layer of melted dark chocolate or chocolate chips between the crust and date filling. Or add your favorite nuts for that added crunch. 
Customization Tips:
Flour Power: Don't have rice flour? Substitute with all oat flour or a combination of oat flour and rolled oats for a more textural experience.
Nutty Delights: Play around with your favorite nut butters in both the crust and filling. Chopped nuts sprinkled on the filling before baking add a delightful crunch.
Vegan Magic: For a vegan option, use melted coconut oil instead of butter or vegan butter and choose vegan-friendly nut butters and chocolate chips.
Dessert Extravaganza: Take these squares to the next level! Top them with a scoop of your favorite vegan or lactose-free ice cream for an indulgent treat.

Gluten Free Moroccan Stuffed Pizza - Madfouna (Vegan Option, LOW-FODMAP)

A Culinary Journey Through Sand and Spice: Gluten-Free and Low-FODMAP Madfouna

The vast expanse of the Moroccan Sahara whispers tales of resilience and culinary ingenuity. Here, amongst the nomadic Tafilalt tribes, a unique flatbread called Madfouna emerged, its name carrying a fascinating double meaning.

The word "Madfouna" originates from the Arabic term "dafan," which translates to "buried" or "hidden." This meaning beautifully reflects the traditional cooking method of Madfouna. Unlike pizzas baked in ovens, Madfouna's dough is transformed by the heat of the desert sand. Imagine a shallow pit dug in the sand, lined with hot coals. The prepared dough is then placed on top, covered with more hot sand, and left to bake until golden brown. This unique technique not only gives Madfouna its name but also imbues it with a smoky, earthy flavor that speaks of the Sahara itself.

But the story of Madfouna goes beyond its cooking method. The second layer of its name's meaning refers to the generous filling nestled within the dough. Unlike pizzas with toppings, Madfouna boasts a treasure trove of flavors tucked inside. Traditionally, resourceful Tafilalt cooks used readily available ingredients. Ground lamb or goat (sometimes substituted with chicken) formed the base, seasoned with a vibrant blend of spices like cumin, coriander, paprika, and turmeric. Chopped onions, eggs, tomatoes, and peppers added pops of color and texture, while the subtle sweetness of raisins offered a delightful contrast. Each bite was a testament to the Tafilalt people's deep understanding of their land and its bounty.

Today, we embark on a culinary adventure to recreate this cherished dish. This recipe reimagines the classic Madfouna with a delightful gluten-free twist, ensuring everyone can experience this taste of the Moroccan desert. We'll explore low-FODMAP alternatives for some ingredients, staying true to the spirit of Madfouna while catering to modern dietary needs.

As you follow these steps, remember that you're not just preparing a meal; you're recreating a culinary tradition born from the heart of the Sahara. This gluten-free and low-FODMAP Madfouna is a testament to the enduring legacy of Tafilalt cuisine and a chance to experience a dish literally and figuratively "buried" in history and flavor. So, let's get started and create a taste of the Moroccan desert, right in your own kitchen!

Ingredients:

**For the Dough:**
- 240 grams of rice flour (brown or white), or a mix of brown rice flour, oat, sorghum flour, and millet flour
- 120 grams of starch (mix of potato and tapioca, or just tapioca, or mix with cornstarch)
- 15 grams of whole psyllium husk
- 7 grams of active dry yeast
- 2 teaspoons of salt
- 1 tablespoon of sugar
- 120 grams of lactose-free Greek yogurt, plant-based yogurt, or normal plain yogurt
- 2 cups of warm water

**For the Filling:**
- 1 pound of ground beef, lamb or chicken (omit for vegan option)
- 2 large leeks or green onions (or normal onions for LOW-FODMAP)
- 3 shredded carrots
- 3 shredded zucchini
- 1 shredded pepper
- 1 celery stick shredded
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 2 teaspoons cumin
- 2 teaspoons ginger
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- Handful of fresh parsley and cilantro, chopped
- 1/2 cup grated lactose free cheddar cheese (optional)

*Measurements in Cups:*
- Rice Flour: Approximately 1 and 1/2 cups
- Starch: Approximately 1 cup
- Whole Psyllium Husk: Approximately 2 tablespoons
- Active Dry Yeast: Approximately 2 and 1/4 teaspoons (equivalent to one standard yeast packet)
- Salt: 2 teaspoons
- Sugar: 1 tablespoon
- Lactose-Free Greek Yogurt: Approximately 1/2 cup
- Water: 2 cups

*Method for Dough:*
1. Activate the yeast by mixing it with sugar and 1/2 cup of warm water; let it sit for 5 minutes until it forms a foam.
2. In a bowl, add psyllium husk to remaining 1 1/2 cups of water and let it sit to form a gel.
3. In a large mixing bowl or stand mixer, combine all the ingredients, including the activated yeast and psyllium gel. Mix until a smooth, malleable dough forms. The water content may vary based on the flours and starches used.
4. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes in a warm place, covered with a clean kitchen towel.

While the dough is resting, preheat the oven at 450¬∞F with a pizza stone or baking tray inside.

*Method for Filling:*
1. In a pan over medium heat, mix all the veggies and spices, letting them simmer until very soft and almost caramelized.
2. Add the meat and cook fully. Set aside to cool before filling the dough.

*Method for Filling the Dough:*
1. Take half of your dough and roll it into a long rectangle. make sure the dough is not too thick. 
2. Spread the filling on one half and fold the other half over it, sealing the edges. Roll the dough again very gently to flatten it more. 
3. With a knife, remove the excess dough. Repeat for the rest of the breads. The number of flatbreads you will get will depend on their size. I got four large flatbreads. 
4. Once ready, place the filled flatbreads on the hot surface and bake for 20 minutes, turning them halfway for an even, golden crispiness on both sides.

Serve your Madfouna fresh out of the oven!


With the enticing aroma of spices swirling through your kitchen, imagine yourself transported to a bustling Moroccan market. Close your eyes and feel the warmth of the desert sun on your skin as you savor the first bite of your creation. This gluten-free and low-FODMAP Madfouna isn't just a meal; it's a journey through time and taste.

So, gather your loved ones, share this delicious dish, and create new memories while keeping this ancient tradition alive. After all, the magic of Madfouna lies not just in its unique cooking method or flavorful filling, but in the stories it tells and the connections it fosters across cultures and generations.

**For the cinnamon rolls:**
- 1 cup tapioca starch (160g)
- 1 1/4 cups brown rice flour (150g)
- 1/3 cup oat flour (25g)
- 1/3 cup super-fine corn flour (50g)
- 2 tsp xanthan gum (5g)
- 1/2 cup brown sugar (100g)
- 1 tbsp active dry yeast (9g)
- 2 tsp baking powder (6g)
- 1 tsp salt (6g)
- 1/2 cup lactose-free warm whole milk (120g)
- 1 egg
- 2 tbsp melted butter (40g)
- 2 tsp vanilla extract

**For the cinnamon filling:**
- 1/2 cup very soft unsalted butter (85g) (to quickly soften your butter place it in a warm 
- 1/4 cup light brown sugar (50g)
- 1/4 cup dark brown sugar (50g)
- 1.5 tbsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

**For the cream cheese icing:**
- 1/2 cup lactose-free cream cheese (100g)
- 1/2 stick soft butter (50g)
- 3/4 cup powdered/icing sugar or brown sugar (90g)

Please note that these are approximate cup equivalents, and for the most accurate results, using a kitchen scale is recommended.

**Method:**

1. **Activate Yeast and Psyllium Gel:**
Mix 60g warm water, half of the sugar, and all the yeast. Allow it to foam.
Mix the remaining 100g water with all the psyllium husk to create a gel.

2. **Prepare the filling:**
In small bowl combine the soft butter, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla and mix well until a soft and homogenous paste forms. Set it aside. 
To quickly soften butter for the cinnamon filling, you can use one of the following methods:

**Microwave Method:**
‚ÄãPlace the butter on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave on low power (20-30% power) for 5-10 seconds. Check the butter's softness after each interval to avoid melting.
‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã**Grating Method:**
If you have a cheese grater, grate the cold butter into small shreds. The increased surface area will allow the butter to soften more quickly at room temperature
‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã **Cutting Method:**
‚ÄãCut the cold butter into small cubes. Allow the cubes to sit at room temperature for a few minutes, or until they are soft enough to easily spread.

Remember to keep a close eye on the butter to prevent it from melting, as the goal is to soften it for easy spreading consistency.

3. **Combine Dry Ingredients:**
In a large bowl, combine tapioca starch, brown rice flour, oat flour, brown sugar, baking powder, xanthan gum, and salt.

4. **Combine Wet Ingredients:**
Create a well in the dry ingredients and add psyllium gel, yeast mixture, warm milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Mix until a smooth but slightly sticky dough forms. Don't worry if the dough seems too sticky as you will be working it on a floured surface


5. **Rolling and Filling:**
Roll the dough into a rectangle on a lightly floured surface.
 Aim for a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Evenly spread the cinnamon filling across the dough, extending to the edges.
‚ÄãTake the candied pecans you made earlier, crush them into smaller pieces and sprinckle them on the filling. 

6. **Cutting Hacks:**
Make lengthwise cuts for easy rolling of the cinnamon rolls, eliminating the need to roll the entire dough at once‚Äîa helpful hack for beginners.

7. **Rising:**
Place the rolls in a butter-greased tray, cover with plastic wrap, and let them rise for 1 to 1.5 hours until doubled in size.



8. **Baking:**
Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C).
Sprinkle some additional candied pecans on your proofed rolls.  
Cover rolls with aluminum foil for the first 15 minutes to trap steam. Uncover and bake for an additional 20 minutes or until golden brown.

9. **Icing:**
While the Rolls are cooking, mix cream cheese, butter, cinnamon, and sugar for the icing.
Generously apply the icing to the warm cinnamon rolls as soon as they are out of the oven.
Adding the cream cheese icing to the cinnamon rolls immediately after they emerge from the oven is a crucial step for a luscious and decadent outcome. The residual heat allows the icing to soften and melt slightly, creating a luxurious glaze that seamlessly envelops each roll. This timing ensures optimal absorption, as the warmth facilitates the incorporation of the icing into the layers of the dough. The result is a harmonious blend of flavors and textures, with the warmth of the rolls complementing the creamy sweetness of the icing for an irresistibly delightful treat.

10. **Enjoy and Store:**
Savor the cinnamon rolls warm. Store any leftovers in an airtight container. Reheat before serving.
You can also store the cinnamon rolls in the fridge for a couple of days or in the freezer for a longer period of time. Reheat in the oven at 350F for 10 min. 


Enjoy!

Sliced and tossed with brown cane sugar, a squeeze of lemon, and a touch of corn starch, the strawberries release their natural sweetness. This step ensures that the galette strikes the perfect balance between sweetness and a slight tang, while the corn starch helps thicken the filling, preventing sogginess.

*Method:*
In a bowl, combine sliced strawberries, brown sugar, lemon juice, and corn starch. Toss gently until the strawberries are well coated. Let it sit for a few minutes to allow the sugar to macerate the strawberries.
If using frozen strawberries, make sure to thaw and drain any excess liquid before mixing them with other ingredients.
Preheat the oven to 400¬∞F (200¬∞C).
Roll out the prepared pie crust on a floured surface, following the method mentioned earlier.
Transfer the rolled-out crust to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Arrange the strawberry filling in the center of the crust, leaving a border around the edges.
Gently fold the edges of the crust over the strawberry filling, creating a rustic pattern.
Optional: Brush the edges of the crust with a beaten egg for a golden finish and sprinkle some sugar on the edges for an added sweet crunch.
Bake in the preheated oven at 400¬∞F (200¬∞C) for 35-40 minutes until the crust is golden brown and the strawberries are bubbly.
Allow the galette to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy this delightful gluten-free Strawberry Galette with its buttery, flaky crust and sweet strawberry filling! Note: Cooking at a higher temperature helps activate the corn starch, preventing the tart from being soggy and too runny.‚Äã


**Baking Perfection:**
Preheat your oven to 400¬∞F (200¬∞C) to achieve the optimal baking environment. As the galette bakes, the crust becomes golden brown and flaky, while the strawberries bubble and intensify in flavor. This higher temperature is crucial, activating the corn starch and ensuring the tart doesn't become overly moist.

**Storage and Serving Suggestions:**
To preserve the freshness of your Strawberry Galette, store any leftovers in the refrigerator. When ready to enjoy again, a quick reheat in the oven or microwave will restore its delightful warmth. Consider serving with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an added layer of decadence. This gluten-free treat is not only a feast for the taste buds but a celebration of the simplicity and elegance of homemade baking.

Enjoy!

The golden, gluten-free crust cradles a luscious base of caramelized leeks blended with cream cheese, creating a symphony of textures and tastes. As each bite unfolds, you'll experience the crisp, flaky layers giving way to the creamy center, crowned by the savory zucchini and tangy feta. This galette is not just a dish; it's a culinary journey through the heart of French-inspired comfort.

**Ingredients:**

**Pie Crust:**

*Ingredients:*
- 165 grams rice flour (fine, brown or white) ( 1 1/4 cups)
- 50 grams tapioca starch (1/3 cup)
- 50 grams corn starch (1/3 cup)
- 65 grams super-fine corn flour (1/2 cup)
- 5 grams xanthan gum (2 tsp)
- Pinch of salt
- 1 tbsp mixed herbs (oregano, basil, rosemary, etc.)
- 180 grams cold butter, cubed (3/4 cup)
- 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 cup or more of very cold water (kept in the freezer until needed)

*Method:*
In a bowl, combine rice flour, tapioca starch, corn starch, super-fine corn flour, xanthan gum, salt, and mixed herbs.
Add cubed cold butter to the dry ingredients and toss until the butter is fully covered.
Pinch the dough with your fingers to break down the butter into smaller pieces, maintaining a somewhat grainy texture.
Mix in very cold water (kept in the freezer) and apple cider vinegar, gently combining everything without kneading the dough too much. The dough should come together but still be slightly sticky.
Form the dough into a round ball, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least an hour or overnight. Resting allows the dough to absorb moisture and enhances flakiness.‚Äã



*Zucchini:*
- 2-3 medium zucchinis, thinly sliced
- Olive oil
- Salt

*Method:*
Mix zucchini rounds with olive oil and salt, ensuring even coating.
Place on a parchment-lined baking tray.
Bake at 390¬∞F for 25-30 minutes until slightly golden brown. Set aside.

*Cream Cheese Base with Caramelized Leeks:*
1/2 cup cream cheese (lactose-free or vegan)
Handful of mixed herbs
1 tbsp olive oil
 Juice of half a lemon
1 tbsp maple syrup
2 caramelized leeks (slice leeks thinly, saut√© in olive oil until golden brown)

*Method*
Mix all the ingredients in a bowl until a creamy texture is reached.
Picture
*Assembly:*
Preheat the oven at 390F
Roll out the rested pie crust on a floured surface.
Spread the cream cheese base over the crust.
Arrange baked zucchini on top. 
Eggwash the sides of your pie crush for a golden brown finish. 
‚ÄãSprinkle some Feta Cheese before putting it to bake 
Bake at 390¬∞F for 20-25 minutes until the crust is golden brown.
Garnish with additional herbs if desired.
Sprinkle some additional Feta Cheese and fresh tomatoes for added freshness before serving. 






*Creating a Rustic Shape:*

One of the delightful aspects of a galette is its rustic appearance, offering flexibility in shaping. Follow these simple steps to fold the sides and form a unique, artisanal look:

**Rolling the Dough:**
   - After resting, roll out the pie crust on a floured surface. Ensure it's large enough to accommodate the fillings with excess edges for folding.

**Adding Fillings:**
   - Spread the cream cheese base over the rolled-out crust, leaving an inch or two from the edges.
   - Arrange the baked zucchini slices evenly over the cream cheese base.

**Folding the Edges:**
   - Begin folding the outer edges of the crust over the filling towards the center. The goal is to partially cover the filling, leaving the center exposed.

**Creating Overlapping Layers:**
   - As you fold, allow the edges to overlap, creating a layered effect. Don't worry about making it perfectly neat ‚Äì the charm of a galette lies in its irregular, free-form appearance.

**Choosing a Shape:**
   - Galettes can take various shapes, from traditional round to rectangular or even freeform. Feel free to experiment and express your creativity. The key is to embrace imperfections for that authentic rustic feel.

**Securing the Folds:**
   - If there are any cracks or tears in the dough, gently pinch them together. The rustic appearance is enhanced by these charming imperfections.

**Baking:**
   - Transfer the shaped galette onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake according to the recipe instructions until the crust achieves a golden-brown hue.

By following these steps, you'll not only achieve a visually appealing galette but also have the freedom to shape it according to your preferences, whether you opt for a classic round look or venture into more creative geometries. Enjoy the delightful fusion of flavors in your uniquely shaped Zucchini and Feta Galette!

The versatility of these pitas makes them a must-have in any kitchen, regardless of dietary preferences.

**Ingredients:**

**For the Dry Ingredients:**
- 12 g whole psyllium husk ‚âà 2.5 tsp
- 145 g brown rice flour ‚âà 1 cup + 1 tbsp
- 80 g tapioca starch or other starch ‚âà 3/4 cup
- 6 g active dry yeast ‚âà 1.5 tsp
- 5 g salt ‚âà 1 tsp

**For the Wet Ingredients:**
- 250 g lukewarm water ‚âà 1 cup + 2 tbsp
- 10 g granulated sugar ‚âà 2.5 tsp
- 20 g olive oil ‚âà 1.5 tbsp

**Additional for Flouring:**
- Extra brown rice flour for flouring the surface

**Method:**

*Preparation for Oven Baking:*
- Place a baking steel, baking steel, or  baking tray on the middle or lower-middle oven rack and preheat the oven to 475¬∫F (250¬∫C).

*Activating the yeast and Making the Psyllium Gel*
Activate the yeast in a separate bowl by combining it with half of the sugar and a bit of lukewarm water, about 1/3 of a cup. Let it sit until it foams.
Prepare the psyllium gel by mixing psyllium husk and the rest of the lukewarm water in a bowl until a gel forms.

*Making the Dough:*
In a stand mixer bowl or large bowl, thoroughly mix all the dry ingredients. Create a well in the center.
Add the psyllium gel, activated yeast, and olive oil into the well. Mix everything into a smooth, supple dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl.

*Divide and Shape:*
Turn out the dough onto a floured surface. Divide it into 6 equal portions of approximately 86g each. Shape each portion into a ball and cover them with a clean dish towel to prevent drying.

*Roll and Proof:*
On a lightly floured surface, roll out each dough ball into a round pita bread of about 5mm thickness. Thinner pitas have a better chance of puffing well. Arrange the rolled-out pita breads on the counter, cover them with a clean dish towel, and let them proof for about 20 minutes at room temperature.


*Bake and Puff:*
Place the pita breads onto the preheated baking steel or tray. Bake at 475¬∫F (250¬∫C) for about 6-7 minutes, until puffed up and golden brown. Flip them after 5 minutes for even browning.

*Steam and Soften:*
Immediately after taking the pita breads out of the oven, wrap them in a clean dish towel. This traps the steam, making the pitas softer and more pliable.‚Äã



**Storage and Reheating Instructions**

- Once the gluten-free and vegan pita breads have cooled to room temperature, store them in an airtight container or a resealable plastic bag.
- Keep them at room temperature for up to 2 days for optimal freshness. If you plan to store them longer, refrigerate for up to one week or freeze for up to three months.

- **Room Temperature Pitas:** If stored at room temperature, simply warm them briefly in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 10-15 seconds on each side.
- **Refrigerated Pitas:** Allow them to come to room temperature or heat them gently in a microwave for 10-15 seconds or on a hot pan for 30 seconds on each side. 
- **Frozen Pitas:** Thaw frozen pita bread. Once thawed, warm them in a dry skillet or in the oven at 350¬∫F (175¬∫C) for 2-3 minutes.

Enjoy!

**Kefta: A Moroccan Culinary Jewel**

In Morocco, kefta holds a special place in the hearts and palates of locals. Whether crafted from lamb, beef, or chicken, these seasoned meat delights are a staple, adored for their succulence and rich blend of spices. Our rendition focuses on the lusciousness of lamb kefta, expertly seasoned and elevated with the indulgent addition of caramelized leeks and a touch of creamy yogurt.

**The Symphony of Flavors: Homemade Pita and Oven-Roasted Veggies**

Before we delve into the star of the show, our lamb kefta, let's not overlook the supporting cast. Refer to our gluten-free pita bread recipe for soft, pillowy pockets that cradle the bold flavors within. The oven-roasted veggies, bathed in a marinade of olive oil, lemon juice, cumin, paprika, salt, and a medley of herbs, contribute a burst of color and freshness to this culinary ensemble. Zucchini, carrots, and red bell peppers are our go-to choices, but feel free to personalize with your favorite vegetables.

**Ingredients**

**Lamb Kefta:**

- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp ground paprika
- 2 tsp ground ginger
- 2 tsp ground cinnamon

Cheesy Hasselback Butternut Squash GF

**Savory Elegance: Cheesy Hasselback Butternut Squash with Beef Salami**

Dive into a world of savory elegance with our Cheesy Hasselback Butternut Squash, a culinary masterpiece that combines the earthy sweetness of butternut squash with the rich, savory flavors of beef salami. This dish not only pleases the palate but also adds a touch of sophistication to your table.

**Ingredients:**

- 1 butternut squash, medium-sized
- Beef salami slices 
- Sliced cheese of your choice, I used fresh lactose free mozzarella and cheddar 
- Fresh rosemary leaves for garnish

*For the Maple-Olive Oil Marinade:*
- 3 tbsp olive oil or a mix of olive oil and salted butter 
- 2 tbsp pure maple syrup
- Juice of half a lemon
- 1 tsp paprika 
- 1 tsp parsley 
- 1 tsp Italian seasoning (or a mix of rosemary, thyme, basil, and oregano)
- Salt and pepper to taste

**Crafting Culinary Magic:**

**Preparation:**
Preheat your oven to 375¬∞F (190¬∞C).
Peel the butternut squash, cut it in half, and scoop out the seeds. 

**Hasselback Technique:**
Place the squash on a cutting board and make thin, evenly spaced slices along its length, being careful not to cut all the way through. This 'hasselback' technique ensures the flavors infuse every inch of the squash. 

**Maple-Olive Oil Marinade:**
In a bowl, whisk together olive oil, maple syrup, paprika, parsley, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. This exquisite marinade will bring a perfect balance of sweetness and richness to the dish.

**First Bake:**
Place the butternut squash on a baking sheet and drizzle half the marinade. Make sure to get it everywhere between the squash slices.
Bake the butternut squash for 25-30 min without adding anything yet. This is to soften the butternut squash before adding the salami and the cheese so as to get a nice crispy and caramelized finish during the second bake, without burning the toppings.

**Second Bake:**
Take the butternut squash out of the oven and gently fan out the slices and tuck in thin slices of beef salami and cheese between them. The savory notes of salami will mingle with the sweetness of the squash and the melty cheese.
Drizzle the rest of the marinade over the squash+toppings.
Bake for a second time for another 20-30, or until the squash is tender, and the top is golden brown.‚Äã



**Garnish and Serve:**
Remove from the oven, sprinkle fresh thyme leaves for a burst of freshness, and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.

**Serving Suggestions:**
- Serve as a side dish at your holiday gatherings or as a stunning centerpiece for a cozy dinner.
- Pair with a light salad or roasted vegetables to complete the meal.
