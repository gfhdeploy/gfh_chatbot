A Perfect Ramadan Suhoor TreatThis delicious and nutritious banana bread is a perfect way to start your Suhoor meal during Ramadan. This recipe goes beyond just being a tasty treat. It's packed with wholesome ingredients that offer various benefits. Bananas provide a natural source of potassium and dietary fiber, both essential for maintaining energy levels during the fast. Dates, often referred to as "nature's candy," are a rich source of essential vitamins and minerals, including iron and magnesium, contributing to overall well-being. Additionally, incorporating nuts like pecans adds a satisfying crunch and introduces healthy fats to your Suhoor meal. The best part? This banana bread is completely vegan and gluten-free, making it a great choice for those with dietary restrictions who may still want to enjoy a delicious and nutritious Suhoor option. 

Ingredients:

Wet Ingredients:
3 medium bananas, finely mashed (about 350g peeled)
1 tbsp lemon juice
115 g (1 stick, ½ cup) vegan butter, melted and cooled until warm or normal butter if not vegan-adhering
150 g (¾ cup) light brown sugar
40 g (3 tbsp) unsweetened plain or Greek-style vegan yogurt, room temperature or normal Greek yogurt
½ tsp vanilla bean paste (or 1 tsp vanilla extract)

Dry Ingredients:
120 g rice flour
72 g tapioca starch
48 g corn flour
2 tsp baking powder
¾ tsp baking soda
½ tsp xanthan gum
½ tsp salt
½ tsp ground cinnamon
50 g  (½ cup) chopped dates
50 g (½  cup) toasted pecans, chopped (optional)
Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) and grease a loaf pan.
In a large bowl, whisk together the mashed bananas, lemon juice, melted vegan butter, brown sugar, yogurt, and vanilla bean paste until well combined.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the rice flour, tapioca starch, corn flour, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum, salt, and cinnamon.
Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
Fold in the chopped dates and pecans (if using) with a spatula.
Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Optionally decorate your Banana Bread with some chocolate pieces. 
Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing it.
​



Tips:
For a richer flavor, you can use ripe bananas with brown spots.
If you don't have vegan butter, you can use melted coconut oil instead.
You can adjust the amount of dates to your taste preference.
To add more protein, you can add ½ cup of chopped walnuts or almonds to the batter.
This bread can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days or in the refrigerator for up to a week.

​Enjoy this delicious and healthy treat as part of your Suhoor meal during Ramadan!

Gluten-Free and Low-FODMAP Brioche Rolls with Savory Chicken and Spinach Filling

The world of baking is a tapestry of textures and flavors. Yet, for those following gluten-free or low-FODMAP diets, some of these delectable creations may seem out of reach. But fear not, for this recipe bridges the gap, offering a delightful solution: Gluten-Free and Low-FODMAP Brioche Rolls with Savory Chicken and Spinach Filling! Imagine the warm, pillowy texture of brioche bread, its rich, buttery flavor, and a delightful savory filling bursting with goodness. Now, imagine enjoying all this while staying true to your dietary needs. This recipe unlocks that very possibility.

Catering to Special Diets:
Gluten-Free: This recipe utilizes a unique blend of gluten-free flours and psyllium husk, a natural binder, to create a dough that rivals traditional brioche in texture and flavor.
Low-FODMAP Friendly: While traditional brioche bread is not considered low-FODMAP due to the presence of wheat flour, this recipe offers a potential alternative. The chosen flours - tapioca starch, rice flour, and oat flour - are generally considered low-FODMAP in moderate amounts. However, it's important to be mindful of portion sizes and consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietician familiar with the low-FODMAP diet if you have any concerns.

The Beauty of Versatility:
The magic of this recipe lies in its versatility. Whether you're strictly gluten-free, following a low-FODMAP diet, or simply looking for a delicious twist on traditional brioche, these rolls cater to your needs. The chicken and spinach filling offers a delightful savory option, but feel free to explore your creativity! Sweet fillings like chocolate chips, cinnamon sugar, or fruit jams (depending on FODMAP tolerance) are equally delicious choices.

Embark on a Delicious Journey:
So, gather your ingredients and prepare to embark on a delightful baking adventure. This detailed recipe will guide you through every step, from activating the yeast to creating beautiful rolls filled with flavor. Get ready to experience the joy of fresh-baked bread, its texture, and its taste, without compromising on your dietary preferences. Let's create a batch of these delectable Gluten-Free and Low-FODMAP Brioche Rolls and savor the delicious possibilities!

Why This Recipe Works for Low-FODMAP:
This recipe specifically caters to a low-FODMAP diet by replacing wheat flour, which is high in FODMAPs, with a combination of gluten-free flours that are generally considered low FODMAP in moderate serving sizes. Here's a breakdown of the flours used:
Tapioca Starch: A great source of resistant starch, known for its thickening properties and considered low FODMAP.
Rice Flour: Both brown rice flour and finely milled white rice flour are generally tolerated well on a low-FODMAP diet.
Oat Flour: While oats themselves contain a moderate amount of FODMAPs, oat flour processed from gluten-free oats is often well-tolerated in smaller quantities. However, it's important to double-check with your healthcare professional or registered dietician if you have any concerns about oat sensitivity.

Now, let's get baking! Here's everything you need to create these delicious rolls:

For the Brioche Dough (Dry Ingredients):
20 g Whole/Rough Psyllium Husk
220 g Tapioca Starch (or chosen starch - potato, arrowroot, etc.)
140 g Rice Flour
85 g Oat Flour
30 g Sugar
10 g Active Dry Yeast
10 g Baking Powder
7 g Xanthan Gum
10 g (1¼ tsp) Salt

For the Brioche Dough (Wet Ingredients):
350 g Lukewarm Water
2 Large Eggs
45 g Avocado Oil (or other neutral oil of choice)

For the Chicken and Spinach Filling (Optional):
1 boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into small cubes
1 tbsp Olive Oil
1/2 tsp Paprika
1/2 tsp Cumin
1/4 tsp Ginger
1/4 tsp Turmeric
2 tbsp Coconut Aminos (or low-FODMAP soy sauce)
1 tbsp Tomato Paste
2 Scallions, thinly sliced
4 cups Fresh Spinach, roughly chopped
1/2 cup Shredded Cheese (optional) - cheddar, mozzarella, or parmesan work well (consider lactose-free cheese for a fully low-FODMAP option)

Egg Wash (for Brushing):
1 Egg
1 tsp Cocoa Powder

Preparing the Chicken and Spinach Filling (Optional):
Before starting with your dough, prepare your chicken and spinach filling to give it time to cool down. 
Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the chicken cubes and cook for a few minutes until slightly browned.
Add paprika, cumin, ginger, and turmeric to the pan, stirring to coat the chicken.
Stir in coconut aminos, tomato paste, and scallions. Cook for a few minutes until fragrant and the scallions slightly caramelize.
Add the fresh spinach and cook until wilted. Season with salt to taste. Set aside your filling and let it cool. 

Creating Your Delicious Rolls: A Step-by-Step Guide
Activating the Yeast:
In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of lukewarm water with 1 teaspoon of sugar. Stir to dissolve the sugar.
Add the active dry yeast and let it sit for 5-10 minutes, until foamy and activated.
Mixing the Dry Ingredients:
In a large bowl, whisk together the tapioca starch (or chosen starch), rice flour, oat flour, sugar, baking powder, xanthan gum, and salt.
Combining Wet and Dry Ingredients:
In a separate bowl, whisk together the remaining lukewarm water, eggs, and psyllium husk "egg" mixture (see note below).
Note: Prepare the psyllium husk "egg" by combine the rest of the water with psyllium husk and let it sit for 5 minutes.
Adding Activated Yeast and Kneading the Dough:
Once the yeast is foamy, add it to the wet ingredients and whisk to combine.
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix with a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook (or a large spoon) until a shaggy dough forms.
Add the avocado oil and continue mixing until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. It will be slightly sticky, but should pull away from the sides of the bowl.
You can also knead the dough by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5-7 minutes, until smooth and elastic.
Shaping the Brioche Longs (Single Rise - Continued):
Roll out the dough into a large log and divide it into approximately 8 or 9 equal parts.
Take one dough ball and with the help of a rolling pin spread it into a rectangle shape of approximately 1/2 inch thickness. 
Take a spoonful of your filling and add it to the bottom half of your rectangle leaving a small border around the edges. You can also add your cheese at this point if using. 
Starting from the edge closest to the filling, carefully roll up the dough tightly into a log shape, enclosing the filling. Pinch the seam to seal.
Rise and Bake:
Place the shaped brioche logs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving space between them for rising. Cover the rolls loosely with plastic wrap and let them rise for 30-45 min, or until doubled in size.
Egg Wash and Baking (continued):
Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F).
In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and cocoa powder to create an egg wash. Brush the tops of the risen brioche logs with the egg wash.
Bake the rolls for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through. A toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean. Keep an eye on the rolls during baking, as the exact time may vary depending on your oven.​


Cooling and Enjoying:
Let the brioche rolls cool slightly on the baking sheet before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. The rolls are best enjoyed warm. ​

Tips for Success:
For a richer flavor: Substitute melted butter for half of the avocado oil in the dough recipe.
Explore your fillings! This recipe offers a delicious savory option, but feel free to get creative with sweet fillings.
Sticky Dough? If the dough feels too sticky while shaping the rolls, you can lightly dust your hands with some tapioca starch or rice flour to prevent sticking.
Leftovers? Allow the cooked rolls to cool completely before storing them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.

With this detailed guide and a touch of creativity, you can create these delectable Gluten-Free and Low-FODMAP Brioche Rolls filled with savory chicken and spinach, or any other filling your heart desires. So, preheat your oven, gather your ingredients, and embark on a delightful baking adventure!

Gluten Free Moroccan Chebakia (Express Version)

​A Taste of Morocco: Gluten-Free Chebakia 

During Ramadan, the holy month in Islam, the streets of Morocco come alive with vibrant celebrations and a symphony of delicious flavors. One of the most cherished sweet treats enjoyed throughout this time is Chebakia, a golden, flower-shaped pastry soaked in fragrant syrup or honey. Traditionally made with wheat flour, this recipe offers a delightful twist - a gluten-free version that allows everyone to indulge in this Moroccan tradition.

Chebakia boasts a unique and complex flavor profile. The base of the dough is delicately spiced with anise seeds, saffron, and a touch of mastic gum, creating a warm and aromatic foundation. Once fried to a golden crisp, the Chebakia are then bathed in a fragrant orange blossom water and honey syrup. This combination of textures and flavors - the crisp pastry yielding to the sweet and floral syrup - is what makes Chebakia so irresistible.

This recipe takes a simpler approach to shaping the Chebakia, making it perfect for busy cooks or those new to the art. We'll be using cookie cutters or a small bowl to create beautiful round shapes, and then folding them into a simple yet elegant design. Finally, for a healthier alternative, we'll be frying the Chebakia in avocado oil and bathing it in pure honey instead of syrup.

So, ditch the gluten and embrace the ease of this recipe! Let's create a batch of these delightful Moroccan cookies and celebrate the sweetness of Chebakia.

Ingredients:(Makes roughly 500g of Chebakia)
Dry Ingredients:
250g Rice Flour
150g Starch (choose tapioca, potato, corn, or arrowroot)
30g Corn Flour (finely milled)
30g Almond Flour, Hazelnut Flour, or Nut Flour of Choice (coconut flour can also be used)
40g Toasted and Finely Ground Sesame Seeds
5g Xanthan Gum
2 tsp Baking Powder
1 tsp Salt
Wet Ingredients:
1 Egg
2 tbsp Cane Sugar (or sugar of choice - adjust to your preference)
1/2 cup Melted Butter and Olive Oil Mixture (start with 1/3 cup and add more if needed)
1 tsp Active Dry Yeast, activated with a little sugar and warm water
1/2 cup Orange Blossom Water (adjust depending on flour combination)
Pinch of Saffron Threads, previously soaked in a little water
1 tsp Ground Mastic Gum
2 tsp Anise Seeds (ground or whole)
Frying and Soaking:
Avocado Oil (for frying)
250ml-300ml Pure Honey
4-5 tbsp Orange Blossom Water

Instructions:
Making the Dough:
In a large bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients: rice flour, chosen starch, corn flour, nut flour, ground sesame seeds, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients: egg, sugar, melted butter and olive oil mixture, activated yeast, orange blossom water, saffron threads (with soaking water), ground mastic gum, and anise seeds.
Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing with a spatula until a soft dough forms. You may need to use your hands to bring the dough together.
Dough Consistency: The dough should be well-hydrated but firm, not sticky. It should feel slightly on the harder side to the touch.
Resting the Dough: Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes. This allows the flours to absorb the moisture and makes the dough easier to work with.
Making the Honey Syrup:
While the dough is resting, in a small saucepan, combine the honey and orange blossom water. Heat gently over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the honey dissolves and the syrup thickens slightly. You want a consistency that coats the back of a spoon but is still pourable.
Shaping the Chebakia:
Lightly dust a clean surface with some starch or flour to prevent sticking.
Divide the rested dough into smaller balls (around tennis ball size) for easier handling.
Working with one dough ball at a time, roll it out on the floured surface to your desired thickness. Ideally, the dough should be thin but not paper-thin.
Creating the Shape:
Use a round cookie cutter or the rim of a small bowl/glass to cut out round shapes from the rolled-out dough.
Take one round and fold the bottom half of the circle towards the center.
Now, gently fold the sides inwards towards the center, creating a triangular or "hat-like" shape with a space in the middle. This allows the honey syrup to soak in later.
You can also create squares and make the "slipper shape" which is simply folding the two sides of your square toward the center so that they meet in the middle, leaving a space in the center for the honey syrup to soak in nicely later.
Repeat the shaping process with the remaining dough balls.
Frying the Chebakia:
Heat your avocado oil in a large pot or deep fryer over medium heat. The ideal temperature for frying is around 350°F (175°C).Why Avocado Oil? Avocado oil boasts a high smoke point, making it perfect for frying. This means it can withstand high temperatures without burning or breaking down, unlike some other oils. Additionally, avocado oil is a good source of healthy monounsaturated fats.
Once the oil reaches the desired temperature, carefully add a few Chebakia shapes at a time. Don't overcrowd the pot, as this can lower the oil temperature and result in greasy pastries.
Fry the Chebakia for 2-3 minutes per side, or until they turn a golden brown color.
Achieving Crispiness: For a deeper golden brown and extra crisp Chebakia, you can fry them for a bit longer, but be sure not to burn them.
Removing from Oil: Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried Chebakia to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
Soaking the Chebakia:
As soon as your Chebakia is out of the frying oil, dunk it into the honey syrup.
Let them soak for 3-4 minutes per batch, ensuring they are well coated with the fragrant syrup
Transfer the soaked Chebakia to another plate or container. You can also transfer them to a bowl with a strainer if you want some of the honey to drip-off.  
Finishing Touches:
Generously sprinkles your chebakia with sesame seeds for an extra nutty flavor and beautiful presentation.
Let the Chebakia cool completely before storing.


Storing:
Store your Gluten-Free Chebakia in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.
Tips:
Feel free to adjust the amount of sugar in the dough to your preference.
Don't overwork the dough when shaping the Chebakia. Overworking can make them tough.
If the dough feels too dry while shaping, add a teaspoon of orange blossom water at a time until it reaches a workable consistency.
Keep an eye on the oil temperature while frying to ensure even cooking and prevent burning.
You can also use a candy thermometer to monitor the oil temperature precisely.

​So there you have it! This recipe offers a delightful twist on the classic Chebakia, making it accessible to those following a gluten-free diet and those who appreciate a healthier frying option. Enjoy the sweet and fragrant flavors of Morocco with this simple and delicious recipe!

Gluten Free Spinach and Leeks Quiche (LOW-FODMAP)
26/3/20240 Comments
 
Picture
A Savory Delight: Gluten-Free Quiche with Caramelized Leeks, Spinach, and Cream Cheese

The quiche, a savory French tart filled with eggs, cheese, and various ingredients, has become a global favorite. Its origins can be traced back to medieval Europe, where similar pastry pockets filled with savory ingredients were enjoyed. Over time, the quiche evolved into its modern form, featuring a flaky pastry crust and a creamy custard filling. The versatility of the quiche is a key to its enduring popularity. The base can be made with traditional wheat flour or a variety of gluten-free alternatives, while the filling options are endless, allowing endless customization based on personal preferences and dietary needs.

This recipe takes a delicious turn towards a gluten-free approach, perfect for those following a gluten-free diet or simply wanting to explore alternative flours. The crust utilizes a blend of rice flour or oat flour (ensure it's certified gluten-free if needed), tapioca or another starch, and a touch of xanthan gum to mimic the elasticity of gluten. This combination, along with the magic of cold butter and a light hand, creates a beautifully flaky and tender crust. The filling features caramelized leeks, adding a touch of sweetness and depth of flavor. Spinach brings a burst of vitamins and vibrant green color, while cream cheese adds a luxurious richness. This recipe is also friendly for those following a low FODMAP diet. Leeks are generally well-tolerated in moderate amounts, and lactose-free milk eliminates the concern of lactose, a major FODMAP.

The Importance of Blind Baking your Quiche:
One key step in achieving a perfect quiche is blind baking the crust. This process involves pre-baking the crust empty before adding the filling. But why is this extra step necessary?
Here's the science behind it:
Prevents Soggy Bottoms: Quiche fillings are typically wet due to the eggs and milk. When the entire quiche bakes together from the start, the moisture from the filling can seep into the unbaked crust, making it soggy and unpleasant. Blind baking allows the crust to cook partially on its own, setting the structure and preventing this dreaded sogginess.
Ensures Even Cooking: By pre-baking the crust, you ensure it reaches a golden brown state without overcooking the delicate egg custard filling later.
The Egg to Milk Ratio:
The typical egg-to-milk ratio for quiche fillings can vary slightly depending on the desired texture and personal preference. Here's a general guideline:
Classic Ratio (1:1): This is a good starting point for most quiches. One whole egg is used for every 1/4 cup (60ml) of milk. This ratio creates a custard filling with a good balance of creaminess and structure.
Richer Ratio (3:1): For a denser and richer custard, you can use three eggs for every 1/4 cup (60ml) of milk. This is perfect for those who love a luxurious and decadent quiche experience.

Ultimately, the best ratio for you depends on your taste and desired texture. Feel free to experiment and adjust the quantities to find your perfect quiche filling!

The filling features caramelized leeks, adding a touch of sweetness and depth of flavor. Spinach brings a burst of vitamins and vibrant green color, while cream cheese adds a luxurious richness. Finally, lactose-free milk ensures everyone can enjoy this delicious quiche.
This recipe is also friendly for those following a low FODMAP diet. Leeks are generally well-tolerated in moderate amounts, and lactose-free milk eliminates the concern of lactose, a major FODMAP.
So, get ready to create a delightful and satisfying gluten-free quiche perfect for a brunch, light lunch, or even a satisfying dinner!
Ingredients: (continued as before...)

So, get ready to create a delightful and satisfying gluten-free quiche perfect for a brunch, light lunch, or even a satisfying dinner!

Ingredients:
For the Gluten-Free Crust:
82 grams (2/3 cup) rice flour or oat flour (ensure it's certified gluten-free if needed)
45 grams (1/3 cup) tapioca starch, corn starch, arrowroot starch, or potato starch
33 grams (1/4 cup) finely milled corn flour
1.5 grams xanthan gum
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 
1 teaspoon salt
85 grams (6 tablespoons) cold butter, cut into small cubes
1/3 cup very cold water (you might need more or less depending on the flours used)
For the Filling:
3 eggs
1/4 cup lactose-free milk (or any milk of your choice)
Pinch of salt
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 leeks, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced
Handful of fresh spinach, roughly chopped
100 grams (about 3 ounces) lactose-free cream cheese, softened
Other:
Olive oil
Baking paper
Pie weights or dried beans/lentils (for blind baking)

Instructions:
Making the Gluten-Free Crust:
In a large bowl, whisk together the rice flour, oat flour, tapioca starch (or chosen starch), corn flour, xanthan gum, and salt.
Using your fingertips, work the cold butter cubes into the dry ingredients until they resemble coarse crumbs. There should still be visible pea-sized pieces of butter for a flaky crust.
Drizzle the apple cider vinegar over the mixture and toss to combine. Gradually add the cold water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing with a fork until the dough just comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough, as this can make it tough.
Form the dough into a disc, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

Making the Filling (while the dough chills):
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced leeks and cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden brown. Season with a pinch of salt.
Once caramelized, add the chopped spinach and cook for an additional minute or two, until wilted. Remove from heat and let cool.

Assembling and Baking the Quiche:
Preheat your oven to 190°C (375°F). Lightly flour a rolling surface and roll out the chilled dough to a circle slightly larger than your pie dish.
Carefully transfer the dough to your desired baking dish (pie dish, tart pan, or even a shallow baking dish will work). Gently press the dough into the bottom and sides of the dish, trimming any excess dough around the edges.
Prick the bottom of the dough with a fork several times to prevent air bubbles. Line the crust with baking paper and fill it with pie weights or dried beans/lentils/rice. This process, called blind baking, helps prevent the bottom crust from becoming soggy.
Bake the crust for 12 minutes at 190°C (375°F). Then, carefully remove the baking paper and weights and bake for an additional 6-8 minutes, or until the crust is lightly golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.

Assembling the Quiche:
In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, lactose-free milk, salt, and oregano.
In the cooled quiche crust, spread the caramelized leek and spinach mixture evenly.
Crumble the softened cream cheese over the leeks and spinach.
Pour the egg mixture over the filling, ensuring it reaches all the corners. Be careful not to overfill the crust, as the quiche will puff up slightly while baking.
Bake the quiche for 30-35 minutes, or until the egg filling is set and no longer jiggly in the center. The edges of the crust should be golden brown.​

Cooling and Serving:
Remove the quiche from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the filling to firm up completely.
Tips:
For a richer flavor, you can substitute grated Parmesan cheese for some of the cream cheese.
Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat slices in the microwave or oven until warmed through.
Feel free to experiment with different vegetables in your quiche. Some delicious options include roasted mushrooms, chopped broccoli, or ground meat.

Enjoy!

Crème Caramel with Date Syrup: A Healthier Indulgence

Craving a silky smooth and slightly sweet dessert but looking to cut back on refined sugar? Look no further than this delightful recipe for Crème Caramel with Date Syrup! This twist on the classic French dessert replaces the traditional sugary caramel sauce with a healthier alternative – homemade or store-bought date syrup. Not only is date syrup naturally sweet, but it also boasts a rich and complex flavor that beautifully complements the creamy custard.
This recipe offers a detailed step-by-step guide, ensuring success even for beginner bakers. I'll also show you how to make your own date syrup at home, but feel free to use a store-bought option if you're short on time. 

​A note on low-FODMAP: Following a low FODMAP diet doesn't mean sacrificing dessert! This recipe offers a delicious twist on Crème Caramel that's perfect for those managing gut health. The key ingredient in this recipe, date syrup, is a natural sweetener that's low FODMAP in moderate amounts. This makes it a perfect substitute for traditional sugary caramel sauce, allowing you to enjoy the creamy custard without digestive discomfort.


If you don't want to use dates, there are other healthier alternatives to the sugar-based caramel:
​Honey: Honey can be a great substitute for date syrup, but make sure it's thick and not runny. If your honey is too thin, heat it gently in a saucepan over low heat until it thickens to a syrup consistency. Be careful not to overheat or burn the honey, as it can lose its flavor.
Maple Syrup: Similar to honey, maple syrup can be used as a caramel replacement. Choose a darker grade of maple syrup for a richer flavor profile. Heat it gently in a saucepan until it thickens slightly, reaching a syrup consistency.
Agave Nectar: Agave nectar is a natural sweetener derived from the agave plant. It has a neutral flavor and can be used as a 1:1 substitute for date syrup. However, agave nectar is high in fructose, so moderation is key.

So, ditch the guilt and indulge in this healthier version of a timeless dessert!

Ingredients:

For the Date Syrup (If making at home):
1 cup (200g) pitted dates (Medjool or similar variety recommended)
2 cups (480ml) water

For the Crème Caramel:
3 large eggs
3 tablespoons (45g) coconut sugar (or brown, cane sugar for low-FODMAP)
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
500 ml lactose-free milk (or your milk of choice)
4-5 tablespoons date syrup (or store-bought)
Cheesecloth

Equipment:
Blender
Saucepan
Whisk
Strainer
Baking dish or ramekins (enough for 3-4 servings)
Larger baking dish (for bain-marie)

Instructions:

Making the Date Syrup (Optional):
In a saucepan, combine the pitted dates and water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat and simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the dates are softened and the mixture has thickened slightly.
Let the mixture cool slightly. Transfer the mixture to a blender and puree until smooth.
Strain the date syrup through a cheesecloth to remove any date particles. Set aside to cool completely.
Making the Crème Caramel:
Preheat your oven to 175°C (350°F).
In a blender, combine the eggs, coconut sugar, and vanilla extract. Blend on high speed for 2-3 minutes, until the mixture becomes light, fluffy, and pale yellow in color.
In a separate saucepan, heat the milk until it boils. Turn off the heat. 
Slowly drizzle the hot milk into the egg mixture while continuously blending on low speed. This will temper the eggs and prevent them from scrambling.
Strain the custard mixture through a cheesecloth to remove any air bubbles or cooked egg bits.
Pour a thin layer of date syrup (around 4-5 tablespoons, depending on your desired sweetness) into the bottom of your baking dish(es) or ramekins.
Carefully pour the custard mixture on top of the date syrup layer.
Fill a larger baking dish with enough hot water to reach halfway up the sides of your individual baking dish or ramekins. This creates a bain-marie, which helps steam the custard and prevents it from curdling.
Place the baking dish with the ramekins or baking tray inside the preheated oven and bake for 1 hour, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.
Remove the custard from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature for about 1 hour.
Cover the ramekins or baking dish and refrigerate for at least 4-5 hours, or overnight, to allow the custard to set fully.​


Serving and Storage:
Once chilled, unmold the crème caramel by running a knife around the edges of the ramekins or the baking dish and inverting them onto a plate. The date syrup will create a beautiful caramel layer at the bottom.
You can serve the crème caramel directly from the ramekins or slice it into portions from the baking dish.
Crème Caramel with Date Syrup can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
Tips:
For a richer flavor, use brown coconut sugar instead of regular coconut sugar.
If you don't have a blender, you can whisk the eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract together until well combined.
Make sure the water in the bain-marie doesn't simmer while baking. You want a gentle steam to cook the custard evenly.
This recipe can easily be doubled to serve more people.

Enjoy this delicious and healthy twist on a classic dessert!

Dive into Deliciousness: Gluten-Free Chaussons with a Low-FODMAP Twist

Craving a delightful appetizer or light meal that caters to gluten-free and low-FODMAP dietary needs? Look no further than these delectable Chaussons! Imagine biting into a golden-brown, flaky gluten-free crust that shatters to reveal a creamy, flavorful filling of savory ground meat, tender spinach, and caramelized leeks. These crowd-pleasing pastries are perfect for entertaining, light lunches, or anytime you desire a satisfying and wholesome treat. Traditionally, chaussons are French turnovers filled with savory ingredients. Their origins can be traced back to the Middle Ages, and they remain a popular snack or light meal in French cuisine today. This recipe takes inspiration from the classics but incorporates a gluten-free flour blend and a low-FODMAP approach, making it suitable for a wider range of dietary needs.

For those following a low-FODMAP diet, this recipe is a breath of fresh air. Often, finding delicious and satisfying options that fit dietary restrictions can be challenging. But fear not! This recipe cleverly avoids ingredients high in FODMAPs, such as onions and garlic, which can cause digestive discomfort. Instead, we rely on the natural sweetness of caramelized leeks and a blend of spices like cumin, ginger, and cinnamon to create a depth of flavor that is both satisfying and gut-friendly.

The gluten-free crust utilizes a combination of brown rice flour (or oat flour), tapioca starch, corn flour, and xanthan gum. This blend not only provides a fantastic gluten-free alternative but also caters to those with other dietary restrictions, such as nut allergies or sensitivities to certain grains. The xanthan gum acts as a binder, mimicking the elasticity of gluten and ensuring a sturdy yet tender crust.

So, whether you're hosting a brunch gathering, planning a movie night with friends, or simply seeking a delicious and satisfying low-FODMAP option, these Gluten-Free Chaussons are sure to become a new favorite. Get ready to experience a symphony of textures and flavors – the delightful crunch of the crust, the creamy comfort of the filling, and a burst of freshness from the spinach – all wrapped up in a convenient and portable package!

Gluten-Free Chaussons with Creamy Spinach, Leek, and Meat FillingThese delightful Chaussons boast a remarkably crispy gluten-free crust that perfectly complements the creamy spinach, leeks, and ground meat filling. They're a delicious appetizer or light meal that caters to gluten-free diets and is sure to impress your guests.




Ingredients:
For the Crust:
125 g brown rice flour (or oat flour)
75 g tapioca starch (or potato starch, or cornstarch)
50 g finely milled corn flour
4 grams xanthan gum
160 g cold butter, cubed
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1/2 to 1 cup cold water
For the Filling:
1/2 pound ground beef or chicken
3 large leeks, chopped
200-250 grams spinach
3 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
Half cup chopped green olives 
1/2 cup grated cheese of your choice (lactose-free cheddar used here)
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon dried oregano
Additional:
1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)​

Instructions:
Making the Crust:
Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the brown rice flour (or oat flour), tapioca starch, corn flour, and xanthan gum.
Cut in the Butter: Add the cold, cubed butter to the dry ingredients. Using your fingertips, gently work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles a coarse crumble. Important: Don't overwork the dough or try to melt the butter completely. Small, pea-sized butter bits are key to a flaky and crispy crust.
Add Liquids: Incorporate the apple cider vinegar and cold water gradually, one tablespoon at a time. You might need more or less of the stated water quantity depending on your flours. Gently mix the dough with your hands until it just comes together. Avoid overmixing – the dough should not be sticky but should hold its shape when pressed together.
Chill the Dough: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, ideally 1 hour. This allows the dough to rest and the gluten-free flours to absorb moisture, resulting in a better texture.
Preparing the Filling:
Caramelizing Leeks: Heat a pan over medium heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. Add the chopped leeks and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and slightly golden brown.
Wilting the Spinach: Add the spinach to the pan with the leeks and cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until wilted.
Brown the Meat: Push the leeks and spinach to one side of the pan and add the ground meat. Cook the meat, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned throughout.
Seasoning and Cream Cheese: Once the meat is cooked, season the mixture with the cumin, ginger, cinnamon, and oregano. Stir in the softened cream cheese and combine with the meat and vegetables until well incorporated. Let the filling cool slightly while you preheat the oven and prepare the dough.
Assembly and Baking:
Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 390°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Divide and Roll Dough: Lightly flour your work surface. Divide the chilled dough into equal portions (depending on desired chausson size). Roll out each portion into a thin circle, about 1/8-inch thick.
Shaping the Chaussons: Place a round cookie cutter or a bowl rim on the dough to cut out perfect circles.
Filling and Folding: Place a generous spoonful of the cooled filling in the center of one half of each dough circle. Sprinkle with some grated cheese (optional). Fold the dough circle over the filling to form a half-moon shape. Crimp the edges with a fork to seal the chausson securely. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
Egg Wash and Baking: Brush the tops of the chaussons with the beaten egg. This will help achieve a golden brown color. Place the chaussons on the prepared baking sheet, leaving a little space between them for even baking.
Oven Time: Bake the chaussons for 25-30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and crispy.​



Serving Suggestions:
Serve the chaussons warm
​
Beyond the Basics:
Feel free to explore your creativity with fillings! Here are some ideas that are also low-FODMAP friendly:
Roasted Butternut Squash and Goat/Feta Cheese: For a vegetarian option, roast diced butternut squash with olive oil and herbs. Combine with crumbled goat cheese or feta cheese and a sprinkle of chopped fresh thyme.
Mushroom and Swiss Delight: Sauté sliced mushrooms with a drizzle of olive oil and fresh thyme. Mix with grated Swiss cheese and a touch of low-FODMAP cream cheese for a decadent filling.

We'll be crafting a delightful vegan msemen that boasts a light and airy gluten-free dough, achieved through a clever blend of rice flour, starches, and psyllium husk. This innovative base, strikingly similar in texture to the classic semolina version, provides the perfect foundation for an explosion of flavor in the form of a savory vegan filling.

This recipe celebrates the bounty of nature with a vibrant vegetable medley. Tenderly caramelized carrots, zucchini, and leeks are seasoned with the warmth of Moroccan spices like paprika, cumin, and ginger. Feel free to personalize the filling to your heart's content - explore possibilities like spiced lentils for a protein boost, melty vegan cheese for a decadent indulgence, or even a sweet option with cinnamon and chopped dates for a satisfying dessert twist.

So, grab your rolling pin, unleash your inner culinary explorer, and get ready to embark on a delicious journey through the heart of Morocco!

Ingredients:

For the Msemen Dough:
84 g rice flour
52 g starch (tapioca, potato, or corn)
34 g finely milled corn flour
1 tbsp psyllium husk
1/2 tsp active dry yeast
1 tsp sugar
1 tsp vinegar
1 tsp Greek yogurt (or other plain yogurt)
1 tsp olive oil
1 tsp salt
1 tsp xanthan gum
Warm water (approximately 100-150 ml)

For Shaping the Msemen:
1/2 cup fine corn flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/3 cup olive oil (or all butter)
1/3 cup melted butter (or all olive oil)

For the Vegan Filling (Optional):
2 grated carrots
2 grated zucchini
2 finely chopped leeks
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp ginger
1 tsp oregano
Salt to taste
3 tbsp olive oil
Handful of fresh herbs (parsley and cilantro)
Handful of green pitted olives (optional)

Method:Make the Msemen Dough:
In a small bowl activate the yeast in warm water with a pinch of sugar. Let it sit for 5 minutes until foamy.
In a large bowl, whisk together rice flour, starch, corn flour, psyllium husk, xanthan gum, and salt.
Add the activated yeast mixture, vinegar, yogurt, and olive oil. Using a dough whisk or your hands, combine all ingredients until a shaggy dough forms.
Gradually add warm water, a tablespoon at a time, until you achieve a smooth, elastic dough that is not sticky. This might take slightly more or less water depending on the specific flours used.
Knead the dough for a few minutes on a lightly floured surface.
Form the dough into 4-5 balls, place them in a greased baking sheet, and cover them with plastic wrap. Let them rest for 5-10 min.
​
Make the Filling:
In a pan over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Add the chopped leeks and cook until softened. Add the grated carrots and zucchini, and cook until tender-crisp. Stir in the paprika, cumin, ginger, oregano, parsley and cilantro, and salt to taste. Cook until a caramelized soft medley of vegetables forms. Remove from heat and stir in the pitted olives. Let it cool before filling the Msemen. 

Shape and Cook the Msemen:
In a small bowl, whisk together the corn flour and baking powder.
In another bowl, combine melted butter and olive oil.
​On a lightly floured surface, generously coat a ball of dough with the oil/butter mixture.
Using a rolling pin, carefully roll the dough out into a thin square, as thin as possible without tearing. Drizzle more oil/butter mixture as needed to prevent sticking.
Sprinkle a generous amount of the corn flour mixture over the dough square.
Spread a few spoonfuls of the prepared filling in the center of the rolled-out dough square.
To shape, fold the two shorter sides of the dough square inwards, overlapping slightly over the filling but not completely enclosing it. Sprinkle more of the corn flour mixture. 
Fold the top and bottom sides inwards in the same manner, again leaving a gap in the center. This creates layers without completely sealing the filling.
Gently brush the top of the folded dough with more oil/butter mixture.
Heat a skillet or non-stick pan over medium-high heat.
Carefully transfer the msemen to the hot pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and puffed. You'll notice the msemen inflate as it cooks, indicating a successful layering process.
Repeat steps 4-13 with the remaining dough balls and filling. 




This delightful vegan msemen recipe offers a delicious and accessible way to experience a Moroccan classic. With its gluten-free dough and customizable filling options, this recipe caters to a variety of dietary needs and preferences. So, gather your loved ones, share a plate of these warm and flaky flatbreads, and embark on a culinary adventure to Morocco!

Unveiling the Creamy Delight of Mahalabiya: A Versatile Treat for All Occasions

Mahalabiya, a smooth and refreshing milk pudding, transcends the boundaries of specific seasons. While traditionally enjoyed during Ramadan and Suhoor meals, its delightful taste and nourishing properties make it a perfect treat to be savored year-round. This recipe offers a versatile approach, catering to various dietary needs and preferences, allowing you to personalize this delightful dessert.

A Legacy of Flavor: Exploring Mahalabiya's Origins
Mahalabiya boasts a rich heritage, originating in the Middle East and spanning various cultures. Known by different names like "Muhallebi" in Turkey and "Muhallebiyah" in the Levant region, this sweet treat has become a cornerstone of Ramadan and celebratory occasions. Its creamy texture and subtle sweetness offer a welcome respite during pre-dawn meals.

​The Science Behind Enjoyment: Why Mahalabiya Makes a Great Suhoor Option
Suhoor meals ideally consist of foods that provide sustained energy throughout the day's fast. Here's what makes Mahalabiya a great choice:
Sustained Energy Release: Milk and milk alternatives, a key ingredient, are a good source of complex carbohydrates, which break down slowly, providing a steady stream of energy.
Electrolyte Replenishment: Milk also contains essential electrolytes like potassium and calcium, crucial for maintaining hydration and proper bodily functions during the fast.
Easy Digestibility: The pudding's smooth texture makes it gentle on the digestive system, promoting comfortable digestion during the long fasting period.

Embracing Modern Dietary Needs: Crafting a Low-FODMAP Mahalabiya
While the traditional recipe often incorporates wheat flour, individuals following a low-FODMAP diet can still enjoy this delightful treat. Here's how:
Alternative Sweeteners: Opt for low-FODMAP sweeteners like maple syrup or rice malt syrup instead of cane sugar. Although you can also use cane or white sugar in moderation. 
Plant-Based Milk Options: Embrace a wider range of milk alternatives like almond milk, coconut milk, or oat milk for a lactose-free and vegan-friendly version.
Thickener Options: Instead of cornstarch, you can use rice flour (in this case, use 6 tablespoons instead of 4).

Ingredients:
Liquids:
2 cups (475ml) preferred milk (dairy, lactose-free, or plant-based milk)
½ cup (125ml) lactose-free cream (or coconut cream for vegan option)
1 tablespoon lactose free cream cheese or other soft creamed cheese of choice (optional)
Sweeteners:
4 tablespoons (60g) cornstarch (or 6 tablespoons rice flour)
1/3 cup (70g) cane sugar (consider low-FODMAP alternatives like maple syrup or rice malt syrup)
1-2 tablespoons (15-30ml) orange blossom water (adjust based on preference)
Flavorings:
3-4 cardamom pods, crushed
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Optional Toppings:
Shaved coconut
Preferred nuts (pistachios used here)
Instructions:
Combining Ingredients: In a saucepan, whisk together the milk, cream, chosen sweetener (sugar, maple syrup, or rice malt syrup), orange blossom water, crushed cardamom pods, and vanilla extract.
Heating and Thickening: Heat the mixture over medium heat, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. As the mixture simmers, it will begin to thicken.
Reaching the Perfect Consistency: Reduce the heat to low and continue whisking vigorously until the pudding reaches a desired thick and creamy consistency. At this point, add your cream cheese if using, and whisk. 
Cooling and Setting: Remove the pan from the heat and transfer the pudding to individual serving jars or glasses.
Adding the Finishing Touches: Top your Mahalabiya with your preferred toppings, such as shaved coconut and nuts.
Chilling and Enjoying: Refrigerate the pudding for at least a couple of hours, allowing it to set completely. As it cools, the texture will thicken further. Mahalabiya is best served and enjoyed cold. ​



Tips:
For a smoother texture, ensure the chosen thickener (cornstarch or rice flour) is fully dissolved before heating the mixture.
Experiment with different nut options for a unique flavor profile.

Mahalabiya offers a delightful way to experience a taste of tradition, transcending its role as a mere dessert. This recipe empowers you to personalize the ingredients based on your dietary needs and preferences, making it a delicious and versatile treat suitable for any occasion. Whether enjoyed during Ramadan and Suhoor meals or savored as a refreshing year-round dessert, Mahalabiya's smooth texture, subtle sweetness, and rich cultural heritage are sure to leave a lasting impression. So, gather your loved ones, whip up a batch of this delightful pudding, and create memories that celebrate flavors and togetherness.

This recipe caters to individuals following a low-FODMAP diet, aiming to minimize potential gut discomfort.

Ingredients:
Dry Ingredients:
½ cup rice flour
½ cup oat flour (or substitute all rice flour or all oat flour)
1 cup sesame seeds
1 cup pecans (almonds are traditionally used, but pecans offer a lower FODMAP option)

Grinding the Nuts:
Texture: Transfer the roasted pecans (or almonds) to the food processor and grind into a fine powder. Be mindful not to over-process and create a paste. Aim for a mixture with some larger pieces for a delightful textural contrast.
Assembling the Sellou:
Combining: In a large bowl, combine the roasted flours, remaining sesame seeds, ground pecans (with some larger chunks for texture), the prepared paste, melted butter and remaining olive oil, and the remaining date syrup/honey.
Nut Butter Integration: Finally, incorporate the chosen nut butter and mix everything thoroughly using your hands until a well-combined, compact, and slightly sticky dough forms.

Whether enjoyed as a satisfying breakfast, a flavorful appetizer, or a light lunch, mini batbout are sure to become a staple on your table.

Today, we'll guide you through crafting these miniature marvels from scratch, complete with a flavorful ground beef and vegetable filling. But remember, the beauty of this recipe lies in its adaptability. Don't be afraid to experiment with different fillings and toppings to personalize your batbout experience and create your own signature dish. So, gather your ingredients, unleash your inner chef, and embark on a delicious journey to Morocco, one bite at a time!
Preparing the Dough: A Step-by-Step Guide
120 g rice flour or gluten-free oat flour 
70 g starch (potato, tapioca, corn, or arrowroot)
50 g corn flour
1 tsp xanthan gum
1 tsp salt
1 tsp active dry yeast
1 tsp sugar
1 tbsp Greek yogurt (or preferred yogurt)
1 tsp baking powder
1-1.5 cups warm water (adjust according to flour type)

Instructions for the Mini Batbout:
Activate the Yeast: In a large bowl, combine the warm water (about 105°F/40°C) with the sugar. Stir to dissolve the sugar and create a sugary water mixture. Add the yeast and let it sit for 5-10 minutes, until it becomes foamy and active. This activation step is crucial for the dough to rise properly.
Combine Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the rice flour, starch, corn flour, xanthan gum, salt, and baking powder.
Mix and Knead: Gradually add the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients with the Greek yogurt and water. Use a spoon or dough whisk to combine until a shaggy dough forms. Lightly flour a clean surface and transfer the dough. Knead the dough for 2-3 minutes by hand, adding a little extra flour if it feels too sticky, until it becomes smooth and elastic. The dough should not be very sticky. 
Rolling Out the Dough: Roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) using a rolling pin.
Cutting and Shaping: Use a round cookie cutter or a glass with your preferred diameter to cut circles from the dough. You can also gently shape the dough into rounds with your hands.
Resting for Perfection: Place the cut dough rounds on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover them loosely with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and let them rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. This allows the dough to rise slightly and become puffier.
Cooking on the Stovetop: Heat a large cast iron skillet or heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, carefully transfer the dough rounds to the pan, leaving some space between them.
Achieving the Golden Touch: Cook the batbout for 1-2 minutes per side, or until they have developed golden brown spots and become puffed up. 
Cooling and Filling: Once cooked, transfer the mini batbout to a clean kitchen towel to cool slightly. Do not stack them while they are hot, as this can cause them to steam and lose their crispness.​​​





​Optional Filling Ingredients:
500 g ground beef
3 carrots, grated
2 zucchini, grated
2 bell peppers, chopped finely
2 cloves garlic (optional for LOW-FODMAP)
2 leeks, chopped (can be replaced with onions)
2 tsp paprika
2 tsp cumin
1 tsp turmeric
2 tsp ginger
2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp dried mixed herbs
Salt and pepper to taste
A handful of chopped parsley
Instructions:
Sautéing the Veggies: Heat a large pan or skillet over medium heat. Add a drizzle of olive oil and saute the leeks and garlic (if using) until softened and slightly translucent.
Adding the Vegetables and Spices: Add the grated carrots, zucchini, and chopped peppers to the pan and cook for another 5-7 minutes, or until softened and slightly caramelized.
Introducing the Meat and Spices: Crumble the ground beef and the spices into the pan and cook thoroughly, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned. ​
Finishing Touches: Finally, add the chopped parsley and cook for another minute, then remove from heat and let the filling cool before filling the batbout.

Filling your Batbout:​​
Once cool enough to handle, use a sharp knife to carefully open a pocket in each batbout. Fill them generously with your prepared ground beef and vegetable mixture, or any other filling of your choice. Add some cheese and olives for extra flavour. 




Now, let the enticing aroma of your creation fill your kitchen as you prepare to take a bite and be transported to the heart of Morocco. Share these delightful mini batbout with loved ones, savor the explosion of flavors, and create lasting memories that go beyond the plate.
