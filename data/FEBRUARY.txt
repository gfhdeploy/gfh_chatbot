**Samoas-Inspired Gluten-Free and Vegan Apple Cookies**
​
Embark on a culinary journey that transforms the beloved Girl Scout Samoas into a healthier and more wholesome delight. The origin of Samoas can be traced back to the iconic Girl Scout cookie lineup, where these delightful treats made their mark. Traditionally featuring a biscuit base topped with caramel, toasted coconut, and a drizzle of chocolate, Samoas have become synonymous with indulgent satisfaction.

This rendition pays homage to these timeless flavors, reimagining the concept with a focus on fresh and nutritious ingredients. In the spirit of creativity and mindful eating, we've replaced the biscuit with crisp apple slices, elevating the cookie base to a vibrant and juicy foundation. The decision to use hazelnut butter, chopped dates, and toasted coconut brings a spectrum of textures and tastes that beautifully harmonize.

Girl Scout cookies are more than just a tasty treat; they represent a tradition of camaraderie and community. This Samoas-inspired apple cookies capture the essence of that tradition while offering a healthier alternative. The adaptability of this recipe aligns with the Girl Scout spirit, catering to various dietary preferences without compromising on flavor.

**Customizable Delight:**
What makes these Samoas-inspired apple cookies truly special is their exceptional customisability. The canvas of flavors and textures is yours to explore, offering a delightful experience with every bite. Choose any nut butter that tickles your taste buds – whether it's the rich creaminess of almond butter, the decadence of cashew butter, or the classic charm of peanut butter. Each nut butter imparts its unique character, enhancing the overall flavor profile.

The toppings are equally flexible, allowing you to embark on a creative journey. Experiment with an array of nuts, such as pecans, walnuts, or hazelnuts, to add a satisfying crunch. Introduce seeds like chia or flax for a nutritional boost, or incorporate dried fruits for a sweet and chewy texture. The versatility of this recipe encourages you to tailor these cookies to your preferences.
*Ingredients:*
- 2 fresh apples, peeled and sliced into rounds
- 3-4 tbsp Hazelnut butter or nut butter of choice 
- 5-6 chopped Medjool dates
- 1/4 cup toasted shredded coconut
- 1/2 cup semi-sweet dark chocolate, melted with 1 tsp coconut oil 
- Toasted pecans

*Method:*

**Step 1: Apple Base**
Peel and Slice fresh apples into rounds.
Using a small spoon, remove the center to create apple "cookies."

**Step 2: Layering**
Place your apple slices on a parchment paper. 
Spread a layer of hazelnut butter on one apple slice.
Add a generous portion of chopped dates and toasted shredded coconut.
Top with another apple slice to create a sandwich.

**Step 3: Chocolate Drizzle**
Melt dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl in the microwave or 
Drizzle the melted chocolate over the apple cookie sandwiches.

**Melting Chocolate :**
To achieve a glossy and smooth texture for your chocolate drizzle, you can opt for either the microwave or the bain-marie method. Both techniques are effective, and the choice depends on your preference and equipment.

* **Microwave Method:**
 Break the chocolate into small, uniform pieces for even melting.
Place the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and add a teaspoon of coconut oil for that extra luster.
Microwave in short bursts, around 15-20 seconds each time, stirring well between intervals.
Be cautious not to overheat; chocolate can burn easily. Once almost melted, stir until the residual heat fully melts the chocolate.

* **Bain-Marie Method:**
Fill a saucepan with water and bring it to a gentle simmer.
Place a heatproof bowl over the saucepan, ensuring it doesn't touch the water. Add the chocolate and coconut oil to the bowl.
Stir constantly as the steam from the simmering water gently melts the chocolate. Remove the bowl from heat once nearly melted, continuing to stir until smooth.

The addition of coconut oil not only enhances the sheen of the chocolate but also provides a subtle tropical flavor. Whether you choose the quick microwave route or the traditional bain-marie method, your chocolate will be ready for a perfect drizzle, adding a finishing touch of decadence to your Samoas-inspired apple cookies.

**Step 4: Toppings**
Sprinkle additional toasted shredded coconut and toasted pecans on top.
Allow the chocolate to set at room temperature or preferably in the fridge for 30 min-1h. 






**Storage Tips for Samoas-inspired Apple Cookies:**
To preserve the freshness and flavor of these delightful treats, proper storage is key. Once assembled, store the apple cookies in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 24h. The cool environment will help maintain the integrity of the apple slices and prevent the nut butter and toppings from becoming too soft. 

Enjoy!

GF Sourdough-Style Bread Buns: A Tangy Delight Without the Starter
1/2/20240 Comments
 
Picture
Welcome to a gluten-free baking adventure where we unravel the secrets of achieving that coveted sourdough taste without the hassle of maintaining a starter. This ingenious recipe introduces a unique hack using Greek yogurt and Apple Cider Vinegar, infusing a delightful tanginess into our soft buns. Paired with the wholesome richness of brown rice flour, the heartiness of oat flour, and the light texture of tapioca starch, these gluten-free buns are a revelation for your taste buds.

**Ingredients:**

*Dry Ingredients:*
- 250g brown rice flour (approximately 1 3/4 cups)
- 100g oat flour (approximately 1 cup)
- 100g tapioca starch (approximately 3/4 cup)
- 50g corn starch or potato starch (approximately 1/3 cup)
- 20g psyllium husk (approximately 2 tablespoons)
- 25g cane sugar or honey (approximately 2 tablespoons)
- 8g salt (approximately 1 1/2 teaspoons)
- 9g active dry yeast (approximately 2 teaspoons)

*Wet Ingredients:*
- 350g warm water (50 grams for yeast activation, and the remaining 300 grams for psyllium gel) (approximately 1 1/2 cups)
- 8g apple cider vinegar (approximately 1 1/2 teaspoons)
- 220g Greek yogurt or other preferred non-flavored yogurt (approximately 1 cup)

**Method:**

**Activate Yeast and Prepare Psyllium Gel:*
Start by activating the yeast. Mix 50 grams of warm water with the yeast and let it sit until it becomes frothy.
In a separate bowl, create a psyllium gel by combining the remaining warm water (300 grams) with psyllium husk. Allow it to form a gel-like consistency.

**Combine Dry and Wet Ingredients:**
In a mixing bowl, bring together all the dry ingredient.
Create a well in the center and introduce the activated yeast, psyllium gel, apple cider vinegar, and the star of our show – Greek yogurt.

**Mix and Knead:**
Embrace the stickiness. This dough, soft and pliable, promises a tender crumb. The addition of yogurt introduces a subtle tang, laying the foundation for a sourdough-inspired bread. Your dough should be light and fluffy and not very sticky.

**Shape and Rise:**
​Shape the dough into buns or explore its versatility to create baguettes or loafs. After you chose your shape, allow the bread to rise for at least 1h to 1h30 in a warm place covered with some plastic wrap and a clean kitchen towel.  



**Bake:**
While the bread is proofing, preheat the oven to 480°F (250°C) with a baking tray or baking stone inside for at least 30-45 min.
Once your bread is doubled in size place it on the preheat baking tray or baking stone and place a baking tray with some boiling water on the bottom rack of the oven to create steam. Steam plays a pivotal role in baking bread, contributing to its crust formation, color development, dough expansion, and controlled oven spring. The moisture from steam delays crust setting, resulting in a thin and crispy exterior with a golden-brown hue.
Bake for 10 min with the steam and then reduce the oven temperature to 390°F (200°C) and cook for an additional 20 min. See Notes below.
Let the bread cool completely before cutting into it. See Notes below. 

**Additional Notes:**
These buns serve as a versatile foundation for countless creations, from sandwiches to morning toasts.​
The cooking time above will vary depending on the shape you picked. This is the cooking time for buns or baguettes. However, for a loaf you will need to let it cook with steam for 20 min at 480°F (250°C) and reduce to 430°F (220°C) for another 45 min-1h. 
Allowing gluten-free bread to cool completely before cutting is crucial to achieving the best texture and structure. Unlike traditional wheat-based bread, gluten-free bread lacks the structural support provided by gluten. When hot, the crumb is more delicate and prone to tearing, which can result in a gummy or dense interior. Allowing the bread to cool allows the starches to set and the moisture to redistribute, leading to a firmer and more stable crumb. This process enhances the overall eating experience, ensuring that the bread retains its intended texture and flavor. 

As the enticing aroma of these gluten-free sourdough-style buns wafts through your kitchen, relish the simplicity of this hack. Enjoy the satisfaction of crafting bakery-worthy bread without the need for a sourdough starter. With each delightful bite, savor the amalgamation of the hearty, the tangy, and the unmistakably gluten-free.

Your gluten-free baking journey just took a tangy turn for the better!

​Enjoy!

This recipe takes inspiration from the traditional parmigiana, offering a crispy, flavorful twist with shallow-fried eggplant and zucchini coated in a unique cornmeal and brown rice flour mixture. Lactose-free cheeses and a dollop of cream cheese add richness and indulgence, while a boiled egg adds a surprising, yet delightful, textural element. This gluten-free masterpiece is sure to impress everyone at the table!

*Ingredients:*
1 medium eggplant, thinly sliced 
1 medium zucchini, thinly sliced 
Brown Rice Flour Mixture:
80g (1/2 cup) brown rice flour
5g (1 teaspoon) paprika
2.5g (1/2 teaspoon) salt
1g (1/4 teaspoon) dried mixed herbs
40g (1/4 cup) cornmeal
120ml (1/2 cup) lactose-free milk or plant-based milk of choice 
1 large egg, boiled and sliced
1 cup high-quality organic tomato sauce
Shredded lactose-free mozzarella cheese to taste 
Dollops of lactose-free cream cheese to taste 
Shredded lactose-free cheddar cheese (optional, any cheese works!) to taste
Fresh basil leaves, for garnish 
Gluten-free crusty bread or your favorite side dish (optional)

*Method:*
Prep the Veggies and Oven: Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F). Line a plate with paper towels. Arrange the thinly sliced eggplant and zucchini in another plate. Boil your egg (12 min), peel and cut and place aside. 
Create the Crispy Coating: In a plate, combine the brown rice flour, paprika, salt, and dried mixed herbs. In another plate, place the cornmeal. In a bowl whisk the lactose-free milk.
Shallow Fry the Vegetables: Heat a thin layer of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip each eggplant and zucchini slice first in brown rice flour mixture, followed by the milk, and finally coat evenly in the cornmeal mixture. Carefully transfer the coated vegetables to the hot oil and fry for a few minutes per side, until golden brown and crispy. Transfer the cooked vegetables to the paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
Layer the Flavors: In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of your delicious tomato sauce. Arrange half of the fried eggplant and zucchini slices in a single layer, followed by half of the shredded mozzarella cheese, the sliced boiled egg, and another layer of sauce. Repeat with the remaining vegetables, sauce, mozzarella, and dollops of cream cheese. Top with any additional cheese of your choice (cheddar is a great option!).
Bake to Perfection: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the top is golden brown and crispy.
Serve and Enjoy: Garnish your masterpiece with fresh basil leaves and serve it hot with your favorite gluten-free crusty bread or side dish. Enjoy the explosion of flavors and textures in every bite!​​


Layering Steps:






Tips and Variations:
Use a non-stick skillet for easier frying and prevent sticking.
Don't overcrowd the pan while frying; cook the vegetables in batches to ensure even browning.
Get creative with the herbs and spices in the flour mixture! Experiment with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, or cayenne pepper for a kick.
If you don't have lactose-free cheese, you can substitute it with other dairy-free options like vegan cheese or nutritional yeast.
Play with the vegetables! Add bell peppers, mushrooms, or even thinly sliced summer squash for more variety.
Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and reheated in the oven until warmed through.

This gluten-free Italian parmigiana with your unique twist is a culinary masterpiece waiting to be devoured! So, gather your ingredients, unleash your inner chef, and create a dish that's both delicious and personal.

This recipe is surprisingly simple to prepare, yet delivers an authentic Moroccan experience, perfect for a cozy weeknight dinner or an impressive dinner party spread. So, fire up your stovetop tajine or cast iron and get ready to be transported to the bustling souks and aromatic kitchens of Morocco!

Gluten-Free and Low-FODMAP:
This recipe eliminates gluten and uses leeks instead of onions, making it suitable for both gluten-free and low-FODMAP diets. Leeks have a milder flavor than onions and are easier to digest for those with GERD. We'll also use garlic as an optional ingredient, allowing you to adjust it based on your individual tolerance.

*Ingredients:*

For the Kefta Mixture:
1 pound (500 g) ground lamb or beef (or a blend)
1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground paprika 
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup gluten-free breadcrumbs (optional for extra meatball softness and moisture )
For the Tajine Sauce:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 garlic cloves (optional)
2 leeks, white and light green parts only, finely chopped
1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained or fresh tomatoes grated 
1-1.5 cups good quality tomato sauce 
1/2 cup vegetable broth or simply water 
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
Eggs (optional)
For Garnish (optional):
Fresh cilantro, chopped

*Method:*
Prepare the Kefta: In a large bowl, combine ground meat, parsley, cilantro, spices, breadcrumbs, salt, and pepper. Mix well until everything is evenly incorporated. Form the mixture into small meatballs, about 1-inch in diameter.
Simmer the Tajine: Heat olive oil in a tajine or large cast iron over medium heat. Add the sliced leek and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
Add the Sauce: Pour in the diced tomatoes and tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat and cover.
Nestle the Kefta: Gently add the meatballs to the simmering sauce, making sure they are submerged but not crowded. Cover again and cook on medium low heat for 35-40 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through and the sauce has thickened slightly. For the last 3-5 min of cooking time make a well in the center of the pot and crack an egg and cover. 
Serve and Savor: Garnish with fresh cilantro. Serve hot with your favorite gluten-free bread and enjoy a taste of Morocco!​



Tips:
Substitute ground chicken or turkey for a lighter option.
Add other low-FODMAP vegetables like carrots, zucchini, or bell peppers for extra color and nutrients.
Add one or two carrot sticks to the sauce while its cooking to naturally add sweetness and balance the acidity of the tomatoes. 
Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

GF and Vegan Super Crispy Smashed Potatoes
13/2/20240 Comments
 
Picture
Introducing a crowd-pleasing favorite: smashed crispy potatoes. These delightful bites are not only incredibly easy to make but also deliver a satisfying crunch with every bite. With just a handful of simple ingredients, you can transform ordinary potatoes into a culinary delight that's perfect as a side dish or even a snack. Let's dive into the details of how to make these irresistible smashed crispy potatoes.

**Ingredients:**
1 kg organic baby potatoes, with skin on
Generous amount of olive oil, for coating the potatoes
2 tsp paprika
2 tsp cumin
2 tsp mixed herbs
1 tsp garlic powder (optional)
Salt, to taste
3 tbsp melted butter (optional or you can use vegan butter)
1 tsp baking soda (for boiling the potatoes)

**Method:**

**Boiling the Potatoes:**
Start by boiling the potatoes with their skins on in a pot of hot water. Add 1 tsp of baking soda to the boiling water. This helps to break down the potatoes' surface, resulting in extra crispy edges once baked. Boil the potatoes until they are fork-tender but still firm, about 15-20 minutes.

**Smashing and Seasoning:**
Preheat your oven to 425°F (approximately 220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Once the potatoes are cooked, carefully remove them from the water and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Use a sturdy glass or flat-bottomed mug to gently smash each potato until it's flattened but still holds together. Drizzle the smashed potatoes generously with olive oil and melted butter, ensuring they are well coated on both sides. Season the potatoes with paprika, cumin, mixed herbs, garlic powder, and salt, making sure to coat each potato evenly with the spices.

**Baking:**
Place the seasoned smashed potatoes in the preheated oven. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until the potatoes are golden brown and crispy on the edges, flipping them halfway through cooking for even browning. Once done, remove the potatoes from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving.​

**Serving Suggestions:**
Enjoy these smashed crispy potatoes as a side dish alongside your favorite protein, such as grilled chicken or steak.
Serve them with a dollop of sour cream or Greek yogurt and chopped chives for added flavor.
These potatoes also make a fantastic appetizer or snack when served with a dipping sauce like aioli or spicy ketchup.

Indulge in the crispy goodness of these smashed potatoes, guaranteed to be a hit at your next gathering or family dinner.

Enjoy!

GF Moroccan Biscotti: Fekkas
10/2/20240 Comments
 
Picture
Fekkas, the beloved Moroccan tea biscuits, are an integral part of Moroccan tea culture. These delightful treats are often enjoyed with a cup of steaming mint tea, especially during festive occasions and social gatherings. Fekkas are known for their crunchy texture, aromatic flavors, and versatility. Traditionally made with wheat flour, this gluten-free adaptation retains all the charm of the original recipe while catering to dietary preferences and restrictions.

**Origin of Fekkas in Morocco:**

In Morocco, Fekkas hold a special place in culinary traditions, symbolizing hospitality and warmth. These crispy biscuits are a staple on Moroccan tea tables, where they are served alongside sweet mint tea, creating a perfect balance of flavors. The name "Fekkas" is derived from the Arabic word "fakkas," meaning "to break into small pieces," reflecting the biscuit's characteristic shape and texture.

**Customization and Adaptability:**

One of the wonderful aspects of Fekkas is their adaptability. While traditionally flavored with sesame seeds and anise, they can be customized to suit individual preferences. This gluten-free version incorporates rice flour, tapioca starch, and corn flour, resulting in a light and crisp texture. The addition of orange blossom water adds a subtle floral aroma, reminiscent of Moroccan gardens.

**Ingredients:**

*Dry Ingredients:*
1 1/4 cups rice flour (170g)
1/2 cup tapioca starch (105g)
1/2 cup corn flour (65g)
1 tsp xanthan gum
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds
2 tbsp anise seeds
200g thinly diced dates or raisins
1 cup almonds and pecans, lightly broken down

*Wet Ingredients:*
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted (113g)
1/2 cup brown sugar (125g)
2 eggs, room temperature
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 cup orange blossom water
1 egg for eggwash 

**Method:**

**Preparing the Dough:**
Preheat the oven to 320°F (160°C). 
In a large mixing bowl, combine the dry ingredients: rice flour, tapioca starch, corn flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, salt, toasted sesame seeds, anise seeds, diced dates or raisins, and broken-down almonds and pecans.
In another bowl, whisk together the melted butter and brown sugar until creamy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract and orange blossom water.
Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add a tablespoon of water at a time until it reaches a smooth consistency. The dough should be wet but not too sticky. 

**Shaping and Baking:**
Divide the dough in half and shape each portion into a log about 2 cm high and 5 cm base. Place the logs on a baking sheet, leaving space between them. Egg wash your logs with one beaten egg and with a fork trace curvy lines to give the characteristic "Fekkas" design (see images below).
Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the logs are firm and lightly golden.
The rolls require a delicate touch in the oven, forming a light crust without fully baking through. We aim for them to be half-baked, where the interior remains slightly soft yet compact texture. When gently pressed, the exterior should yield with a bit of springiness.
Remove from the oven and let the logs cool overnight wrapped in a clean kitchen cloth. Alternatively, cover the logs with a damp cloth for at least 2 hours before cutting them. This is to make sure they do not crumble and break during the cutting process.


**Slicing and Final Baking:**
Using a sharp knife, slice the logs into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Place the slices cut-side down on the baking sheet.
Return the slices to the oven and bake  at 270°F (130°C) for an additional 30-40 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp. Make sure to turn them half way through so they brown on both sides. 
Once cooled completely, remove from the baking sheet and transfer to your place of choice.​


**Storage and Serving Tips:**
To preserve the freshness and crispiness of Fekkas, store them in an airtight container at room temperature or in the fridge. They will remain delicious for several days, perfect for enjoying leisurely tea breaks or sharing with friends and family. When serving, accompany these biscuits with a pot of hot mint tea for an authentic Moroccan experience. Alternatively, pair them with your favorite hot beverage or enjoy them as a standalone snack. 

Enjoy!

**Step 1: Prepare the Salmon**
Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the salmon fillet on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Drizzle the salmon with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Rub the oil and salt evenly over the salmon.

Prepare the flax egg by mixing ground flaxseed with water, then add it to the bowl.
Gradually add the gluten-free flour to the mixture, stirring well to combine.
If the mixture seems too dry, add a few tablespoons of water until you achieve compact mixture.




**Step 3: Shape and Cook the Patties**
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.
Form the salmon mixture into patties of desired size, ensuring they hold together well. You can place them in fridge or freezer for 15-20 to make them easier to handle. 
Carefully place the patties in the skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through.
Once cooked, transfer the patties to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.


**Step 4: Serving and Storage**
Serve the salmon patties hot, garnished with additional chopped parsley or a squeeze of lemon juice, if desired.
Leftover patties can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat in a skillet over medium heat until warmed through.

Bursting with exotic flavors and aromatic spices, this traditional dish combines tender chicken, briny olives, and fragrant herbs to create a culinary masterpiece that will delight your senses. Served alongside crispy fries, this hearty and comforting meal is perfect for sharing with family and friends.

**Ingredients:**
1 whole chicken, cut into pieces (or whatever cuts of the chicken you prefer)
4 tablespoons olive oil
Salt, to taste
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander (cilantro)
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup green olives, pitted
4 potatoes, peeled and cut into fries
2 leeks, sliced
1-2 cups water

**Instructions:**

**Preparation:**
In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces with olive oil, salt, ground turmeric, chopped fresh coriander, ground ginger, and ground cinnamon. Mix well to ensure the chicken is evenly coated with the spices. Let marinate for at least 30 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator for maximum flavor.
Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) for the fries. 
**Cooking the Chicken Tajine:**
Heat a tajine or large skillet over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken pieces to the tajine and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes per side.
Once the chicken is browned, add the sliced leeks and water to the tajine, distributing them evenly around the chicken pieces. Cover the tajine with a lid and simmer gently for about 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.
Remove the chicken from the tajine and set aside. Add the pitted green olives to the sauce in the tajine and let it simmer until the sauce thickens to a chunky gravy-like consistency.



**Preparing the Fries:**
While the chicken is cooking, spread the peeled and cut potatoes onto a baking sheet in a single layer. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt.
Bake the fries in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden and crispy, flipping them halfway through cooking for even browning.

**Serving:**
Once the sauce has thickened and the fries are crispy, return the cooked chicken pieces to the tajine, arranging them on top of the sauce. Place the crispy fries on top of the chicken and sauce.
Garnish with additional fresh coriander (cilantro) if desired, and serve hot, allowing everyone to dig in and enjoy the vibrant flavors of Morocco.

**Storage:**
Any leftover Moroccan Chicken Tajine with Olives and Fries can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat gently in the microwave or on the stovetop before serving. If the sauce is too thick, add a few tablespoons of water to get it back to its original consistency.

1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Salt and pepper, to taste
Fresh parsley for garnish

**Instructions:**
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the sliced leeks, and sauté until the leeks are soft and browned, about 10 minutes.
Add the diced sweet potatoes to the pot, along with the ground cumin, ground cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Stir well to coat the sweet potatoes with the spices.
Pour in the vegetable broth, increase the heat to high, and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender and easily pierced with a fork.

**Blending:**
Using an immersion blender, carefully blend the soup until smooth and creamy. Alternatively, transfer the soup in batches to a blender and blend until smooth, then return it to the pot.​


**Finishing Touches:**
Stir in the coconut milk, adjusting the amount to achieve your desired level of creaminess. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if needed.
Allow the soup to simmer gently for another 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.​


**Serving:**
Ladle the velvety creamy soup into bowls and garnish with fresh parsley for a pop of color and freshness.
Serve hot and enjoy this comforting and nutritious Sweet Potato and Leek Velvety Creamy Soup as a satisfying meal or starter.

**Storage:**
Store any leftover soup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave before serving. Alternatively, you can freeze the soup in freezer-safe containers for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating.

Enjoy!

Introducing Mini French Baguettes: A Bite-Sized DelightElevate your next gathering or indulge in a personal treat with these adorable Mini French Baguettes. Inspired by the classic French staple, these bite-sized wonders offer a delightful combination of crispy crust and airy crumb. This recipe adapts your original gluten-free and vegan French baguette recipe to create individual baguettes perfect for dipping, sharing, or savoring on their own.

Ingredients:
(For approximately 8 mini baguettes)

Dry Ingredients:
25 g (5 tbsp) whole psyllium husk
180 g (1 1/2 cups) tapioca starch or other starch of your preference (e.g., potato starch, cornstarch)
180 g (1 1/2 cups) brown rice flour
60 g (1/2 cup) oat flour
2 tbsp brown sugar
2 tsp salt
7 g (2 tsp) active dry yeast
Wet Ingredients:
500 g (~2 cups) lukewarm water
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar

Instructions:
Combine the dry ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the psyllium husk, tapioca starch, brown rice flour, oat flour, brown sugar, salt, and yeast.
Mix in the wet ingredients: Add the lukewarm water, olive oil, and apple cider vinegar to the dry ingredients. Using a wooden spoon or stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix on low speed until a shaggy dough forms.
Knead the dough: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes, or until smooth. 
Shaping the baguettes: See visual instructions from the original recipe here 
Divide the dough into 8 equal portions.
Pat a piece of dough into a small rectangle. Fold the dough over itself like you are rolling cinnamon rolls, into a log. Pinch the dough together to seal.
Roll the dough back and forth to reach your desired length for each baguette. Repeat with the other two portions of dough.
Roll each dough piece into a long, thin oval shape, approximately 6-7 inches long and tapering the ends slightly.

Baking: Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C) with a baking tray inside. Once the baguettes have risen score them with a bread lame and place them directly onto the hot baking tray you preheated in the oven and add a baking dish with some ice cubes to create steam. Close the oven promptly and let the baguettes cook with steam for 10 min. After 10 min reduce the oven temperature to 425°F (220°C) and bake for another 10-12 min until golden brown. 
Cooling and serving: Let the baguettes cool completely before slicing and enjoying.​

Additional Tips:
For a crispier crust, preheat your baking sheet in the oven while it preheats.
You can brush the baguettes with a bit of olive oil or water before baking for a deeper golden brown color.
Experiment with different toppings like herbs, seeds, or vegan cheese before baking.
Store leftover mini baguettes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. They can also be frozen for later enjoyment.

A Taste of Morocco: Gluten-Free and Egg-Free Pain Tacos (Moroccan Tortilla Bread) with Spiced Chicken Filling

​Beyond the bustling souks and vibrant culture, Morocco offers a treasure trove of culinary delights. Among these gems rests the Tacos, a versatile flatbread traditionally enjoyed with savory fillings. This recipe, adapted to be gluten-free and egg-free, captures the essence of this Moroccan staple while catering to dietary restrictions. We've also included a delicious spiced chicken filling recipe for a complete meal.

Why We Love This Recipe:
Simple and Satisfying: Few ingredients and minimal steps come together to create a delicious and customizable base for your favorite toppings.
Dietary Friendly: This recipe caters to those following gluten-free and egg-free diets, ensuring inclusivity at your table.
Flavorful and Authentic: The combination of warm spices and the subtle sweetness of almond flour transports you to the heart of Morocco.
Adaptable and Fun: Experiment with different fillings (like spiced vegetables, shredded chicken, or falafel) and toppings (like avocado, cheese, and vegan mayo) to create endless flavor combinations, perfect for any occasion.

Ingredients:
For the Tortilla Bread/Pain Tacos:
25 grams psyllium husk (1/4 cup)
500 grams warm water (2 1/4 cups)
2 teaspoons salt
60 grams olive oil (1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons)
200 grams rice flour (1 1/2 cups)
120 grams tapioca starch (1/2 cup) or other starch of choice like potato starch or cornstarch
80 grams corn flour (1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons)
For the Spiced Chicken Filling:
1/2 pound (approximately 230 grams) boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon turmeric
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon dried mustard
1 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
Juice of half a lemon
1 tablespoon olive oil
Other Fillings and Toppings (Optional):
Oven-grilled zucchini slices
Oven-baked french fries
Avocado slices
Lactose-free mozzarella cheese
Vegan mayonnaise

Instructions:
For the Tortilla/Pain Tacos:
In a large bowl, whisk together the psyllium husk and warm water. Let it sit for 5 minutes, allowing the psyllium husk to thicken and form a gel-like consistency.
Add the salt, olive oil, rice flour, tapioca starch, and corn flour to the psyllium husk mixture. Using a hand mixer or wooden spoon, mix well until a dough forms. The dough will be slightly sticky, but manageable.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough for a few minutes until smooth and elastic.
Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a thin circle, about 6-7 inches (16-18 cm) in diameter.
Heat a cast iron skillet over medium heat.
Cook the Pain Tacos: Place the rolled dough on the preheated griddle. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until lightly golden brown and cooked through.
Wrap the cooked Pain Tacos in a clean kitchen towel to keep them warm and soft while cooking the remaining dough.

For the Spiced Chicken Filling:
In a bowl, combine the chicken pieces, paprika, salt, ginger, turmeric, oregano, mustard, garlic powder (if using), and lemon juice. Mix well to coat the chicken evenly. Let the chicken marinate for 30 min or even overnight. 
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken and cook until the chicken is cooked through and golden brown.​






Making the Tacos and the Basic Fold:
Spoon your fillings slightly off-center: Place your fillings a little closer to one edge of your bread. This will leave extra space for folding and help avoid messy spills.
Fold the bottom up: Gently fold the bottom edge of the Pain Taco upwards, partially covering the fillings.
Fold in the sides: Next, fold both sides of the taco inwards towards the center, partially overlapping to enclose the sides of your fillings.
Roll to secure: Continue rolling the taco upwards from the folded bottom towards the opposite edge, keeping it fairly tight.​

Tips for a Secure Roll
Don't overfill: Overloading your Pain Taco can cause it to fall apart. Stick to a reasonable amount of fillings for easy rolling and a mess-free experience.
Fold with slight pressure: When folding, apply gentle pressure to help the taco maintain its shape and keep the fillings in place.
Grilled/Crisped Tacos: Lightly pan-fry the taco seam-side down in a little oil over medium heat until crisp and golden. This adds texture and helps hold the taco together.​

Tips:
Feel free to use any other fillings and toppings you enjoy.
Leftover Pain Tacos can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. 

​Enjoy!

A Legacy Baked in Flavor: My Grandmother's Special Moroccan Harsha Dyal Ferran

These delicate oven-baked semolina cookies, more than just a treat, transport me back to a childhood steeped in Moroccan traditions. Every bite is a memory. The sweet symphony of orange blossom water whispers of my Nana's infectious laughter, the aromatic warmth of anise seeds evokes the comforting hum of her humming, and the subtle earthiness of sesame seeds brings back the warmth of her embrace.
But Harsha Dyal Ferran holds a deeper significance. It's a testament to my grandmother's resilience and resourcefulness. During challenging times, her ability to transform simple ingredients into culinary magic became a beacon of hope and joy, filling our home with warmth and love.

This recipe, a carefully guarded family secret, not only captures the unique flavor profile of these special cookies but also embodies the spirit of my grandmother. It's a gluten-free, vegan, and low-FODMAP version, ensuring everyone can partake in the magic. So, gather your loved ones, brew a pot of Moroccan tea, and embark on a culinary journey through memory and love. Let the aroma of Harsha Dyal Ferran fill your kitchen and create your own cherished memories.

Ingredients:
1 cup fine corn flour
1 cup corn semolina flour (a bit coarser than corn flour)
1/4 cup brown sugar (or sugar of your choice)
1 tsp mastic gum powder
1 tsp cinnamon powder
1 vanilla sachet (or 2 tsp vanilla extract)
1 stick unsalted butter (melted, 113 g)
1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds
3 tbsp anise seeds
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 cup orange blossom water
1/2 cup water (may need more or less depending on corn flour)
Instructions:
Gather your ingredients and preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients: fine corn flour, semolina flour, sugar, mastic gum powder, cinnamon, sesame seeds, anise seeds, and vanilla extract (if using).
Incorporate the wet ingredients: Add the melted butter, olive oil, orange blossom water, and water. Using a spoon or your hands, mix well until a wet and sticky dough forms. Be mindful that the dough should be looser than typical cookie dough, but don't worry, it will firm up as it rests. You should have a wet dough/batter consistency. 
Rest and shape the Harsha: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 30-40 minutes. This allows the corn flour to absorb the moisture and creates a more manageable consistency for shaping.
Form the cookies: Lightly wet your hands to prevent sticking. Take small portions of dough and roll them into balls. Flatten the balls slightly to create small, round patties.
Garnish and bake: Arrange them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each cookie for even baking.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown on the edges and firm to the touch.
Cool and enjoy: Let the cookies cool completely and enjoy!​

Picture
Picture
Tips:
If your dough feels too dry after resting, add a little more water, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the desired consistency.
Feel free to adjust the amount of anise seeds to your preference.
For a richer flavor, brush the baked cookies with melted honey or maple syrup while they are still warm.
Store leftover Harsha Dyal Ferran in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days or in the fridge for up to two weeks.

Enjoy these cookies with a warm cup of Moroccan tea for an authentic experience. Immerse yourself in the rich flavors and cherish the memories they evoke, carrying on the legacy of your grandmother's love with every delicious bite.

Dietary Friendly: Easily adaptable to gluten-free and dairy-free preferences with simple substitutions. Also LOW-FOMAP.
Moist & Flavorful Salmon: The marinade ensures the sockeye salmon stays moist and tender while adding a delightful layer of flavor.

Ingredients:
For the Salmon and Potatoes:
1 pound sockeye salmon fillets (skin-on or skinless, your preference)
500 grams organic baby potatoes, halved or quartered
For the Herb Marinade:
2 tablespoons vegan mayonnaise or mayonnaise of choice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried dill
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon mixed dried herbs
1 teaspoon dried garlic (optional, omit for low-FODMAP)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C).

Prepare the potatoes: Use the rest of the marinade for the baby potatoes.
Assemble and bake: Arrange the marinated salmon fillets in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Scatter the seasoned potatoes around the salmon.
Cover and bake for the first half: Cover the baking sheet tightly with aluminum foil and bake for 15-20 minutes. This initial covered baking helps steam the salmon and potatoes, ensuring they cook evenly and the salmon stays moist.
Uncover and finish baking: Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the salmon flakes easily with a fork and the potatoes are tender and golden brown.​



Tips & Variations:
For a richer flavor: Drizzle the salmon with melted butter or olive oil before baking.

Gluten-free: Use gluten-free breadcrumbs or crushed nuts for a crispy topping (optional).
Dairy-free: Substitute olive oil for butter in the herb marinade.

​Enjoy this simple yet satisfying salmon and potato bake, and savor the delightful combination of flavors and textures!

Additional Notes:
The cooking time may vary slightly depending on the thickness of your salmon fillets and the size of your potato pieces.
Be sure to check the internal temperature of the salmon using a food thermometer. The recommended safe internal temperature for cooked salmon is 145°F (63°C).

Gluten-Free Kaab el Ghazal: Embarking on a Delicious Journey into Moroccan Culture

A Bite of History:
Imagine yourself wandering through bustling Moroccan streets, the air thick with the aroma of spices and freshly baked treats. Amidst the vibrant tapestry of sights and smells, your eyes land on delicate crescent-shaped pastries, exuding an ethereal fragrance. These, my friend, are the Kaab el Ghazal, aptly named "Gazelle Horns" for their graceful shape and alluring aroma. More than just delectable bites, these pastries are woven into the rich tapestry of Moroccan culture, offering a glimpse into its history, traditions, and the warm spirit of its people.

Their origins remain shrouded in the mists of time, with some tales tracing them back to the Berber tribes who inhabited the region for centuries. Others whisper of Andalusian influences, hinting at a cross-cultural exchange that enriched Moroccan cuisine. Regardless of their exact origin, Kaab el Ghazal have become synonymous with celebration and joy. They grace festive tables during Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan with a burst of sweetness. They are offered to guests as a gesture of hospitality, symbolizing the warmth and generosity that lie at the heart of Moroccan culture.

The crescent shape itself holds significance, echoing the moon, a symbol of renewal and hope in Islamic tradition. The delicate horns evoke the elegant gazelle, an animal revered for its beauty and grace, further tying the pastry to the natural world that inspires so much of Moroccan art and culture. Each bite of a Kaab el Ghazal is a journey through the senses. The flaky, melt-in-your-mouth dough, crafted with centuries-old techniques, gives way to a filling bursting with the aromatic sweetness of orange blossom water and the rich nuttiness of almonds, pistachios, or even hazelnuts. This symphony of flavors, textures, and scents is a testament to the culinary heritage of Morocco, where simplicity and elegance mingle to create truly unforgettable experiences.

Today, Kaab el Ghazal continue to evolve, transcending borders and adapting to diverse dietary needs. My gluten-free adaptation is a testament to this resilience, ensuring that everyone can enjoy a taste of this cultural treasure. So, come along, embark on this delicious journey, and discover the magic of Kaab el Ghazal, a bite-sized piece of Moroccan history and culture waiting to be savored.

Ingredients:
For the Dough:

50 g tapioca starch
35 g corn flour
1/2 tablespoon powdered sugar
1 tablespoon orange blossom water

1/2 egg (can be replaced with 1 tbsp plain/greek yogurt)
60 ml milk
1 teaspoon xanthan gum
For the Filling:
300 g hazelnut powder (or almond powder, or your preferred nut, finely ground)
160 g powdered sugar
4 tablespoons coconut oil or melted butter
2 tablespoons orange blossom water
1 teaspoon powdered mastic gum (optional)
Additional Materials:
Rolling pin
Sharp knife or cookie cutter
Baking sheets
Parchment paper
Wire rack
Powdered sugar for dusting (optional)

Instructions:
Making the Dough:
Gather your ingredients: Ensure all flours are finely ground. Have your orange blossom water, softened butter, and other wet ingredients ready.
Whisk the dry ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the rice flour, tapioca starch, corn flour, powdered sugar, and xanthan gum.
Cut in the butter: Using a pastry cutter or your fingertips, work the softened butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles coarse crumbs.
Incorporate the wet ingredients: Whisk together the egg, milk, and orange blossom water. Gradually add this mixture to the dry ingredients, mixing until a soft dough forms. Avoid overmixing.
Chill and relax: Divide your dough into four and wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight for better results.
Preparing the Filling:
Embrace the nutty goodness: Grind your chosen nuts to a fine powder. Ensure there are no coarse pieces for a smooth filling.
Whisk the sweetness: Combine the nut powder, powdered sugar, and orange blossom water in a bowl. Whisk until well combined and the mixture takes shape.
Add richness and texture: Melt the coconut oil (or butter) and mix it into the filling until fully incorporated.
Enhance the aroma: Add a teaspoon of powdered mastic gum for its unique, resinous aroma.
Form a paste:Using a mixer grind all your ingredients until obtaining a sticky and compact paste to for your filling.
Form small logs: Using your hands form small logs that will constitute your filling and set them aside. 

Shaping and Baking:
Preheat your oven: Set your oven to 360°F (180°C) when you are ready to cook. Remember that you need to let the Gazelle Horns dry at room temperature and uncovered for at least 3-6 hours before baking them to ensure they keep their beautiful shape and a crispy outer layer. 
Roll out the magic: On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to a thin sheet, about 1/8 inch thick.
Fill and seal: Place one of your pre-made filling logs onto the rolled out dough and close the dough on itself. with your fingers start from the middle towards the end gently pressing to form a crescent. Seal the edges firmly to prevent the filling from leaking out. Take your sharp knife or cookie-cutter and cut the extra dough around your newly formed crescent roll. See the video below.
Let them rest: This is crucial! Arrange the shaped pastries on the baking sheet and let them dry for at least 3 hours, ideally 6 or even overnight. This allows the gluten-free flours to set and ensures they hold their shape during baking.
Embrace the golden glow: Bake the pastries for 10-12 minutes, or until lightly golden brown. Don't overbake, as they can become dry.
Cooling and indulgence: Let the pastries cool slightly on the baking sheet before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Savor the delightful combination of flaky dough, nutty filling, and fragrant orange blossom water.​


Tips:
If the dough feels dry while shaping, add a teaspoon of milk or water at a time until it becomes pliable.
For a richer filling, replace half the coconut oil with melted butter.
Experiment with different types of nuts for the filling, like pistachios or walnuts.
Enjoy these pastries fresh, but they store well in an airtight container for up to 5 days at room temperature. Otherwise you can keep them in the fridge for up to 10 days or freeze them for up to a month.

​Ingredients:
Dry:

200 g (1 ¾ cups) oat flour
140 g (1 cup) tapioca starch or starch of choice
140 g (1 cup) rice flour
10 g (2 tsp) table or sea salt
Wet:
600 g (2 ½ cups) warm water, divided (300 g & 300 g)
30 g (6 tbsp) psyllium husk
20 g (2 tbsp) apple cider vinegar
150-180 g (½ cup - ¾ cup) mixed seeds of your choice (sesame, sunflower, pumpkin)
Garlic Bread:
50 g (4 tbsp) softened butter
2 tbsp olive oil
3 cloves garlic, finely diced
Handful parsley, chopped
1 tbsp mixed herbs (thyme, oregano, rosemary)
Instructions:
Activate the Yeast (10 minutes): In a large bowl, combine 300 g of warm water (around 105°F/40°C) and the yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy and activated.
Form the Psyllium Gel (5 minutes): In a separate bowl, combine the remaining 300 g of warm water with the psyllium husk. Whisk well and let it sit for 5 minutes until it thickens into a gel-like consistency.
Combine Dry & Wet Ingredients (5 minutes): Add the oat flour, tapioca starch, rice flour, salt, sugar, and activated yeast mixture to the psyllium gel. Mix well with a wooden spoon or spatula until a shaggy dough forms.
Knead & Incorporate Seeds (5 minutes): Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 minutes. Add your chosen seeds and knead further until evenly distributed.
Rise (45-60 minutes): Grease your loaf pan (9x3.5 inches / 23x9 cm) with oil or line it with parchment paper. Shape the dough into a loaf and place it in the prepared pan. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for 45-60 minutes, or until doubled in size.
Prepping for the Bake (10 minutes): Preheat your oven to 430°F (220°C). While the oven heats, brush the risen dough with a mixture of water and dissolved sugar to help the seeds stick. Sprinkle generously with additional seeds of your choice.
Baking the Loaf (60 minutes): Bake the loaf for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If the top starts to brown too quickly, tent it with aluminum foil for the last 10 minutes.
Cooling & Storing (1-2 hours): Let the loaf cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. For best texture, wait at least 1 hour before slicing. Store leftover bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days or freeze for longer storage. 



Bonus: Garlic Bread Transformation (15 minutes):
Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C).
In a small bowl, combine softened butter, olive oil, finely diced garlic, chopped parsley, and mixed herbs. Spread the mixture evenly on cooled bread slices.
Arrange the slices on a baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.
Enjoy the warm, garlicky goodness as an appetizer, side

A Journey of Flavors: Creamy Vegan & Gluten-Free Pumpkin Squash Risotto (FODMAP-Friendly)

Step into a cozy Italian trattoria with every comforting bite of this creamy vegan and gluten-free pumpkin squash risotto. A celebration of fall flavors and rich tradition, this dish transcends mere sustenance, offering a heartwarming dance of textures and tastes. Roasted squash and vibrant pumpkin puree weave magic with Arborio rice, simmered in vegetable broth for a creamy, satisfying experience, all without gluten, dairy, or FODMAP concerns. Forget the bustling streets and vibrant squares for a moment - imagine the aroma of leeks and simmering broth filling a warm kitchen. Sunlight streams through the window, illuminating a table set with simple elegance. In the center, a steaming pot awaits, holding the promise of culinary comfort and community. This is the essence of risotto, a dish rooted in simplicity yet elevated by careful technique and respect for seasonal bounty.

More than just food, risotto embodies the very soul of Italian culture. It's a dish cooked with love, often shared amidst laughter and conversation. The slow, stirring process becomes a ritual, fostering connection and bonding. In kitchens across Italy, families gather around simmering pots, passing down cherished recipes and memories through generations. This recipe captures that spirit, offering a modern twist on a timeless classic. We embrace the creamy texture without dairy, using plant-based alternatives and the sweetness of pumpkin and squash without gluten. It's a journey of flavors, each ingredient contributing to the symphony on your plate.

So, gather your loved ones, embrace the slow stirring ritual, and embark on a culinary adventure that nourishes both body and soul. 
Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 large leek, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced
1 garlic, finely diced (optional)
1 cup pumpkin puree (homemade or store-bought)
1 cup Arborio rice (rinsed)
4-5 cups vegetable broth or water (warmed, additional broth may be needed)
1/4 cup parmesan cheese, grated (optional)
1/4 cup vegan cream cheese (optional)
1/4 cup heavy cream or coconut cream (optional)
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
​2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
Pinch of salt and pepper, to taste
Fresh herbs (such as rosemary or thyme) for garnish
​​​

Instructions:
Pumpkin Prep (Optional): If making your own pumpkin puree, preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Cut a pumpkin in half, remove seeds and strings. Roast flesh-side down for 25-30 minutes, or until soft. Scoop out flesh and discard skin. 
Sauté Symphony: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the leek and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the rest of your herbs and salt. If using, add the garlic and cook for another minute, until fragrant. (Note: For FODMAP-sensitivity, use only the white and light green parts of the leek.)
Toasty Rice: Add the rinsed Arborio rice and toast it, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. This helps develop a nutty flavor and creamy texture.
Broth & Build: Gradually add the warmed vegetable broth, one ladleful at a time, stirring constantly and allowing the rice to absorb the liquid before adding the next ladleful. This process takes about 15-20 minutes. You may need more broth depending on your desired consistency.
Pumpkin Power: Stir in the pumpkin puree and cook for another minute, allowing the flavors to meld.
Creamy Creation (Optional): If using any of the optional creamy additions, stir them in once the rice is almost cooked through and continue stirring until incorporated and the mixture thickens slightly.
Flavor Finale:  Garnish with fresh herbs, if desired.​





Tips & Variations:
Toast chopped walnuts or pecans for a delightful textural contrast.
Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and reheated gently in a saucepan or microwave.
You can substitute other vegetable purees for the pumpkin puree, such as sweet potato. You can also make it with just the broth and add a protein. 
Experiment with different herbs and spices to create your own unique flavor profile.
​​

Embrace the Joy of Risotto:
This recipe is just a starting point. As you become familiar with the technique, don't be afraid to experiment and make it your own. Remember, risotto is more than just a dish; it's a shared experience, a celebration of flavor and community. So, gather your loved ones, crank up the Italian tunes, and let the slow stirring become a meditation, a ritual that brings you closer to the heart of this culinary legacy.

Buon appetito!

Craving the Crunch Without the Compromise: Healthier, Gluten-Free, Egg-Free "KFC" ChickenLet's be honest, who doesn't love the satisfying crunch and juicy tenderness of classic fried chicken? But traditional versions often come loaded with hidden sugars, unhealthy fats, and potential gluten and egg concerns. Fear not, flavor fiends! This recipe reimagines that crispy, crave-worthy experience, delivering a healthier, gluten-free, and egg-free alternative that satisfies without sacrifice.
Why We Love This Recipe:
Clean & Lean: This chicken uses lean cuts like breasts or thighs, marinated in a flavorful blend of herbs and spices, reducing the need for heavy breading.
Gluten-Free Goodness: Rice flour, tapioca starch, and corn flour create a crispy coating that caters to gluten-free needs, ensuring everyone can enjoy.
Egg-Free Feast: No eggs? No problem! The yogurt-based marinade and clever dredging technique deliver perfect texture without relying on eggs.
Shallow Fry Savvy: We ditch the deep-frying method, opting for a light shallow fry that reduces oil intake while still achieving maximum crispness.
Flavorful Fun: This isn't just "healthy" chicken; it's packed with savory spices and herbs, delivering a burst of flavor in every bite.
Ingredients:
For the Marinade:
1 pound (500 g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs
1 cup water
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
2 tablespoons lactose-free plain Greek yogurt
For the Coating:
1 cup rice flour
2/3 cup tapioca starch
1/3 cup + a tablespoon corn flour
1 teaspoon paprika
​1 teaspoon mixed dried herbs 
1/2 teaspoon salt
For Frying
Avocado oil or any oil with high smoking point like sunflower oil etc. 
Instructions:
Marinate Me: Wash and pat dry your chicken. In a large bowl, whisk together the marinade ingredients and add the chicken pieces. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours, for maximum flavor infusion.
Flour Power: In a separate bowl, combine the rice flour, tapioca starch, corn flour, paprika, and salt. Mix well to create a uniform coating mixture.
Dredge & Dress: Prepare your skillet with a thin layer of oil over medium heat. Have the marinade bowl and flour mixture readily accessible. One by one, take a chicken piece out of the marinade, letting excess drip off. Dredge it in the flour mixture, then dip it back into the marinade briefly. Finally, coat it generously again in the flour mixture, ensuring a thick, even layer.
Sizzle & Shine: Carefully add the coated chicken to the hot oil. Fry for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Don't overcrowd the pan, fry in batches if needed.
Drain & Devour: Transfer the fried chicken to a paper towel-lined plate to absorb any excess oil. Let it cool for a few minutes before digging in.​

Serving Suggestions and Storage:
Classic Comfort: Enjoy your crispy chicken with mashed potatoes, coleslaw, and gravy for a comforting, familiar meal.
Salad Sensation: Top a bed of greens with chopped chicken, your favorite veggies, and a light vinaigrette for a healthy and satisfying lunch or dinner.
Sandwich Star: Tuck leftover chicken into whole-wheat buns with lettuce, tomato, and your favorite toppings for a flavorful and portable lunch.
Storage Savvy: Let the chicken cool completely before storing it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 10-15 minutes, or until warmed and crispy.
With its light, crispy texture, juicy chicken, and burst of flavor, this recipe proves that healthy and delicious can go hand-in-hand. So, gather your ingredients, fire up the skillet, and experience the satisfying crunch of chicken done right – the healthier, gluten-free, egg-free way!

Gluten Free Crispy Italian Rice Balls - Arancini (Vegan option)

Bite-Sized Treasures of Sicily: Gluten-Free Arancini with Leftover Risotto
Imagine strolling through the vibrant streets of Palermo, Sicily, sunlight glinting off colorful street vendors. The aroma of fried goodness draws you in, revealing golden spheres of deliciousness - Arancini. These delectable rice balls, filled with savory surprises, are a treasured comfort food in Italy, enjoyed at picnics, street fairs, and casual meals alike.
Traditionally made with Arborio rice cooked in rich broth and seasoned with saffron, Arancini come in various sizes and fillings. The most popular versions boast succulent ragù (meat sauce), creamy mozzarella, or melty ricotta. Today, we'll be recreating this magic gluten-free, using leftover risotto and transforming it into crispy, bite-sized wonders.
But wait, there's more! This recipe is incredibly versatile. Use any leftover risotto you have, be it creamy mushroom, vibrant tomato, or even festive pumpkin like ours. The possibilities are endless, limited only by your imagination and leftover bounty. So, gather your ingredients, crank up some Italian tunes, and let's embark on a culinary adventure to Sicily, one Arancino at a time!

Ingredients:
1 cup cooked risotto (any leftover variety works)
¼ cup rice flour
¼ cup tapioca starch
1 large egg, beaten
1 cup lactose-free mozzarella cheese, cut into small cubes (optional)
Olive oil or avocado oil, for frying
Salt and pepper to taste
Your favorite marinara sauce for dipping (optional)

Method:
Risotto Revival: First things first, get your risotto ready! If using leftover risotto that's a bit dry, add a splash of water or broth to loosen it up slightly. It should be moist but not sticky.
Cheese Delight (Optional): If you're using cheese, prepare your mozzarella cubes. Remember, you can skip this step for a vegan option or switch to your favorite cheese variety.
Arancini Assembly: Now, the fun begins! Grab a tablespoon of risotto and gently shape it into a ball. Make a well in the center and, if using, pop in a cube of cheese. Carefully fold the rice around the cheese to enclose it completely, ensuring a smooth, round ball with no cracks. Repeat with the remaining risotto, creating as many Arancini as you desire.
The Coating Trio: Prepare two bowls. Fill one with a mix of rice flour and tapioca starch, and another with the beaten egg. Season each bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper.
Dredge and Dress: Take one Arancino ball and roll it in the rice+tapioca mix, coating it evenly. Next, dip it into the egg, ensuring complete coverage. Finally, roll it in the flour mix again, creating a light, crispy crust. Repeat this process for all the Arancini.
Frying Fiesta: Heat a generous amount of oil in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat. The oil should be hot enough to sizzle when you drop a bread cube in, but not smoking. Carefully lower the Arancini into the hot oil, frying them in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy.
Draining Delight: Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fried Arancini to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. Let them cool slightly before serving.
Dipping Dreams: While the Arancini cool, warm your favorite marinara sauce (optional). Arrange the golden beauties on a platter and dig in! Each bite will transport you to a sun-drenched Sicilian street, the flavors bursting with warmth and comfort.​

Storage and Tips:
Leftover Arancini can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat them in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 10-15 minutes, or until crispy again.
For a healthier option, bake the Arancini instead of frying. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and bake them for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown and crispy.
Get creative with your fillings! Experiment with leftover cooked vegetables, chopped cooked meats, or even vegan cheese alternatives.
This recipe is a wonderful way to use up leftover risotto, reducing food waste and transforming it into a delicious new dish.
So, there you have it! With this recipe, you can bring the magic of Arancini into your own kitchen, gluten-free and bursting with flavor.

Gluten Free Easy Panini Bread

Does the mere thought of a perfectly toasted panini send your taste buds into a frenzy, only to be dampened by the limitations of gluten-free options? Well, fret no more! This recipe isn't just another gluten-free substitute – it's a revelation, transforming homemade panini from a dream into a delicious, achievable reality. No complicated steps or exotic ingredients stand in your way. This recipe is designed for baking enthusiasts of all levels, delivering on both texture and satisfaction. Imagine fluffy, golden buns cradling your favorite sandwich fillings, all crafted with the pride and delight of knowing they're entirely gluten-free. So, dust off your baking sheet, gather your pantry staples, and get ready to experience the magic of homemade panini without boundaries.

Ingredients:
Wet:
1 tablespoon (15 g) psyllium husk
1 ½ cups (370 ml) warm water, divided
1 tablespoon (10 g) olive oil
1 tablespoon (10 g) apple cider vinegar
Dry:
1 ¼ cups (125 g) rice flour, plus extra for dusting
1 cup (120 g) tapioca starch, potato starch, or corn starch
½ cup (85 g) oat flour
1 tablespoon (15 g) granulated sugar
1 ½ teaspoons (10 g) active dry yeast
1 ½ teaspoons (7 g) salt

Instructions:
Psyllium Power: In a bowl, whisk the psyllium husk with 1 cup (240 ml) warm water. Let it sit for 5 minutes to form a gel, the foundation for your gluten-free magic.
Yeast Awakening: In a separate bowl, combine the remaining ½ cup (130 ml) warm water with the yeast and sugar. Let this bubbly mixture sit for 5-10 minutes, awakening the yeast and promising delightful airiness in your panini.
Dry Ingredient Symphony: In a large bowl, whisk together rice flour, your chosen starch, oat flour, sugar, and salt. 
The Doughy Union: Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour in the psyllium gel, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, and the activated yeast mixture. Using a spatula or your hands, mix until a shaggy dough forms, the dough should be slightly sticky and come off the sides of the bowl.
Knead for Perfection: Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes. Remember, don't integrate too much flour to your dough, a slightly sticky dough is your friend, leading to pillowy buns, not dry bricks.
Rise and Panini Formation: Shape the dough into a ball, nestle it on a floured surface, and roll it out with a rolling pin into a rough rectangle. Divide the dough into 6 equal portions. Place the portions on a baking sheet lined with baking paper and let them rise for 1h to 1h30 min depending on the temperature in your kitchen, until they double in size. Cover them with a plastic wrap and a clean kitchen towel. 
Oven's Fiery Embrace: At least 30 minutes before your dough is done rising, preheat your oven to 480°F (249°C) with a baking tray or baking stone inside. This ensures the stone/tray is scorching hot for even baking, the key to a beautiful crust.
Creating Steam: Carefully transfer the risen panini buns to the preheated baking tray/stone. Immediately lower the oven temperature to 425°F (218°C) and introduce a burst of steam. Pour 1 cup of boiling water into a separate baking dish placed on the bottom oven rack, creating a steamy haven for your buns to rise further and develop a beautiful crust. Close the oven and bake for 10 minutes.
Golden Glory: Remove the steam source and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the panini buns are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Imagine the aroma filling your kitchen, a promise of pure deliciousness.
Cooling Anticipation: Let the panini bread cool completely on a wire rack before slicing and enjoying. This might be the hardest part but its very important for the paninis to dry from the inside and not be gummy. ​



Ways to Use Your Panini Bread:

Classic Toasted Panini: This is the star of the show! Grill your bread to golden perfection and load it up with your favorite fillings like mozzarella, roasted vegetables, pesto, grilled chicken, or cured meats. Don't forget a drizzle of olive oil or balsamic glaze for extra flavor!
Salad Croutons: Tear the bread into bite-sized pieces and toast them until crispy. These make a delicious and gluten-free addition to salads, soups, or even yogurt parfaits.
Bruschetta Bites: Toast the bread slices and rub them with garlic cloves. Top with diced tomatoes, fresh basil, a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper for a refreshing appetizer.
Grilled Cheese: Skip the traditional bread and use your panini buns for a delightful twist on a classic. Pair it with creamy cheeses like brie or havarti and add thinly sliced apples or pears for a touch of sweetness.
​
​Storage Tips:
Room Temperature: Store them in an airtight container for up to 2 days at room temperature.
Refrigerator: For longer storage, wrap the bread tightly in plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
Freezer: Slice the bread and freeze individual portions in airtight freezer bags for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before using.

Enjoy!
