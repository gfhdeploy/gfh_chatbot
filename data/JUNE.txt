A Taste of Morocco: Fluffy Stovetop Mkhamer (Gluten-Free Cheese-Stuffed Pita Bread)

In the heart of bustling Moroccan kitchens, a symphony of aromas unfolds. Fragrant tagines simmer, releasing clouds of warm spices, while the rhythmic slap of dough against a hot griddle fills the air. This is the birthplace of Mkhamer, a humble yet beloved flatbread that holds a special place in Moroccan cuisine.
Unlike the airy pockets of pita bread, Mkhamer boasts a unique personality. Imagine a delightful marriage between a fluffy pancake and a satisfying flatbread. Its texture is soft and yielding, with a gentle chew that begs for another bite. A hint of sweetness dances on the tongue, a subtle counterpoint to the savory dishes it often accompanies.

Traditionally, Mkhamer finds its way onto the table at every meal. Mothers and grandmothers prepare the dough with practiced ease, their hands moving with the wisdom of generations past. The air crackles with anticipation as the Mkhamer puffs slightly, its surface developing beautiful golden brown spots. The beauty of Mkhamer lies in its versatility. It's enjoyed warm from the griddle, perhaps drizzled with a touch of olive oil for a simple breakfast. Moroccan families often tear pieces of Mkhamer to scoop up the rich 'marqa' or sauce of their tagines, that form the cornerstone of their meals. The soft bread soaks up the vibrant flavors, creating a delicious and satisfying bite in every mouthful. Beyond its functional role, Mkhamer also holds a social significance. Sharing a meal of Mkhamer with loved ones is a gesture of warmth and hospitality. It's a bread that brings people together, fostering conversation and laughter around the table.

This recipe offers a taste of Morocco in your own kitchen. Whether enjoyed hot off the pan or used as a base for flavorful fillings, this gluten-free recipe ensures that everyone can savor a piece of Moroccan tradition.

What Makes Mkhamer Special?

Unlike regular pita bread, Mkhamer offers a delightful textural experience. Imagine a thicker, fluffier flatbread with a satisfying chew. While it lacks the pronounced puff of a pita, Mkhamer makes up for it in pure comfort food appeal. A touch of sweetness lingers in the background, perfectly complementing savory fillings like cheese or spiced meats. This recipe lets you choose: enjoy them plain for a satisfying snack or transform them into flavor-packed pockets with the optional cheese filling. Mkhamer is a versatile bread perfect for a quick lunch, a light dinner accompaniment, or even a fun appetizer.

Ingredients (makes 6 Mkhamer):

Dry Ingredients:
120 g Rice Flour
20 g Oat Flour (or Sorghum Flour)
80 g Tapioca Starch (or Cornstarch/Potato Starch)
3 g Instant Yeast (or Active Dry Yeast, see note)
9 g Psyllium Husk Powder
5 g Salt
15 g Sugar
Wet Ingredients:
250-270 g Warm Water
2-3 tbsp Olive Oil
100 g Shredded Mozzarella Cheese (Optional)

Note: If using active dry yeast, you'll need to activate it before using it in the recipe. See the activation instructions below.
Method:
Activate Dry Yeast (Optional):
In a small bowl, combine 1 teaspoon of sugar with a little bit of your warm water. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. The mixture should become foamy, indicating the yeast is active. Proceed with the recipe as instructed, adding the activated yeast mixture along with the other wet ingredients.
Combine Dry Ingredients:
In a large bowl, whisk together the rice flour, oat flour (or sorghum flour), tapioca starch, instant yeast (or activated dry yeast), psyllium husk powder, and salt.
Add Wet Ingredients:
Gradually add the warm water to the dry ingredients, mixing with a dough whisk or a spoon until a shaggy dough forms.
Knead and Rest:
Once all the water is incorporated, knead for 5-7 minutes. The dough will be slightly sticky but should come together and form a smooth ball. Add half of the olive oil to the dough and knead it in until fully incorporated.
Rise:
Lightly coat a clean bowl with the remaining olive oil. Place the dough ball in the oiled bowl, turning it to coat all sides. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
Divide and Shape:
Divide the risen dough into 6 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball and cover them with a damp cloth to prevent drying.
Heat the Pan:
Place a cast iron skillet or a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. There's no need to add any oil to the pan.
Flatten and Fill (Optional): (See note below)
On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll out one dough ball into your desired thickness. If using cheese, sprinkle a handful of shredded mozzarella in the center of the dough circle. Note: If not using cheese, simply roll out the dough ball and proceed to step 9.
Folding and Sealing: Carefully lift the edges of the dough circle and bring them together over the filling (if using), pinching the seams to seal. Shape the sealed dough ball back into ball then flatten again into your desired thickness with the rolling pin.
Cook the Mkhamer: Carefully transfer the Mkhamer to the preheated pan. Cook for 4-5 minutes per side over medium-low heat, or until golden brown spots appear on the bottom.
Repeat and Enjoy: Cook the remaining Mkhamer following the same steps. These flatbreads will puff up slightly when flipped, but not as much as regular pita bread.​

​These fluffy Mkhamer are perfect on their own, enjoyed warm from the pan. They make a delightful breakfast option with melted butter and drizzled with a touch of honey or maple syrup. For a more substantial meal, use them as a base for sandwiches filled with roasted vegetables, savory meats, or falafel. Their versatility extends beyond just handheld meals; they're also fantastic for soaking up the delicious juices of a Moroccan tagine.

Tips & Storage:
Dough Consistency: The dough will be slightly sticky, but it shouldn't stick excessively to your hands. If the dough feels too dry, add a tablespoon of water at a time until it reaches the desired consistency.
Cooking Temperature: Maintain medium-low heat when cooking the Mkhamer. This allows them to cook through evenly without burning the outside.
Leftovers: Store leftover Mkhamer in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. You can refresh them by warming them in a skillet or toaster oven.

​Enjoy this delicious taste of Morocco! Feel free to experiment with different fillings or herbs to create your own unique variations of Mkhamer.

Viral Sensation: The Crispy Baked Potato Yogurt Summer Salad (Gluten-Free & Customizable!)

The internet has been buzzing about a refreshing summer salad that's not just delicious but also incredibly versatile. We're talking about the Crispy Baked Potato Yogurt Summer Salad, a symphony of textures and flavors that's perfect for beating the heat and satisfying your taste buds. This recipe takes advantage of simply roasted, then crisped potatoes tossed in a creamy yogurt sauce, creating a delightful contrast between warm and cool, soft and crunchy.

But the beauty of this viral salad lies in its customizability. Whether you're following a gluten-free or vegan diet, this recipe can be easily adapted to your needs. We'll guide you through the essential ingredients and variations, ensuring everyone can enjoy this light and refreshing summer sensation.

Gluten-Free & Delicious:
This recipe uses simple, naturally gluten-free ingredients, making it a safe and satisfying option for those with gluten sensitivities.

Vegan Twist:
For a vegan version, simply swap the Greek yogurt for your favorite plant-based yogurt alternative. Coconut yogurt or a creamy cashew-based yogurt work beautifully in this recipe.

A Symphony of Flavors:
The creamy yogurt sauce is packed with tangy pickles, fresh dill, and a hint of sweetness from maple syrup or honey. This delightful combination complements the crispy potatoes perfectly, creating a truly addictive flavor profile.

Ingredients:
For the Crispy Potatoes:
1 kg (2.2 lbs) Baby Potatoes (organic, skin-on)
1 tbsp Oregano
1 tsp Paprika
Salt to taste
3 tbsp Olive Oil
1 tsp Garlic Powder

For the Yogurt Sauce:
1 cup Greek Yogurt (or preferred plant-based yogurt)
½ cup Chopped Cucumber Pickles
1 small Red Onion, finely chopped
2 tsp Dijon Mustard
1 tbsp Maple Syrup (or Honey)
Salt and Pepper to taste
1 tbsp Olive Oil
1 tsp Oregano
1 tbsp Dried or Fresh Dill
1 tsp Garlic Powder
2 Garlic Cloves, grated

Instructions:
Prep the Potatoes: Wash and scrub the baby potatoes thoroughly, as their skins will be part of the deliciousness. Opt for organic potatoes whenever possible.
Boiling the Base: In a large pot, cover the potatoes with water and bring to a boil. Cook for 30-40 minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork. Drain and let them cool slightly.
Preheat the Oven: While the potatoes are boiling, preheat your oven to 250°C (480°F).
Crispy Time! Once cool enough to handle, halve the potatoes and spread them out on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle generously with oregano, paprika, salt, and garlic powder. Using your hands, gently massage the spices into the potatoes, aiming to break them down slightly for maximum crispiness.
Oven Magic: Bake the potatoes for 40-50 minutes, or until golden brown and gloriously crispy.
Yogurt Sauce Symphony: While the potatoes bake, prepare the yogurt sauce. In a medium bowl, combine chopped pickles, red onion, Dijon mustard, maple syrup (or honey), olive oil, oregano, dill, garlic powder, and grated garlic cloves. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Fold in the Greek yogurt (or your chosen plant-based alternative) until well combined. Let the sauce chill in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
Salad Sensations: In a large serving bowl, combine the crispy potatoes and the chilled yogurt sauce. Toss gently to coat all the potatoes evenly.
Serving Up Sunshine: For an extra layer of freshness, serve your salad on a bed of lettuce. Enjoy this delightful summer salad on its own or as a refreshing side dish.​
Picture
Tips & Variations:
Spice it Up: Like a bit more heat? Feel free to add a pinch of red pepper flakes or chili powder to the yogurt sauce for a zesty kick.
Herb Heaven: Fresh herbs like chives or parsley make a lovely addition to the finished salad.
Leftovers Delight: This salad stores well in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.

I hope you enjoy this Crispy Baked Potato Yogurt Summer Salad! It's a viral sensation for a reason. It's light, refreshing, bursting with flavor, and incredibly customizable. So, fire up your oven, whip up this delightful salad, and experience the taste of summer in every bite!

Gluten Free Light Lemon Sponge Cake (with Lemon Drizzle)

​Sunshine on a Plate: A Luscious Lemon Sponge Cake (Gluten-Free!)

There's something undeniably comforting about a classic sponge cake. But what if you could elevate this familiar treat with a burst of sunshine-y lemon flavor and a texture so light, moist, and spongy it practically melts in your mouth? Look no further! This recipe unlocks the secret to a gluten-free lemon sponge cake, perfect for celebrating summer or simply indulging in a delightful afternoon treat.

Gluten-Free Baking Made Easy:
For our gluten-free friends, this recipe utilizes a blend of alternative flours like brown rice flour, tapioca starch, and corn flour. Xanthan gum acts as a binding agent, mimicking the gluten found in wheat flour and ensuring a fantastic cake structure. Don't worry, these gluten-free alternatives create a cake that's just as light and airy as its traditional counterpart.

A Symphony of Lemon:
The key to this cake's magic lies in the generous use of fresh lemons. Zest adds a vibrant citrus aroma, while the lemon juice infuses the batter with a delightful tang that perfectly complements the sweetness of the sugar. Finally, the lemon drizzle, a simple syrup of sugar and lemon juice, adds an extra layer of moisture and flavor, making every bite a burst of sunshine.

Ingredients:
Dry Ingredients:
130 g (1 cup) Brown Rice Flour or Millet Flour
80 g (⅔ cup) Tapioca Starch
50 g (½ cup) Finely Milled Corn Flour
2 g Xanthan Gum
7 g (2 tsp) Baking Powder
160 g (¾ cup) Cane Sugar (or your preferred sugar)
Pinch of Salt
Zest of 2 Large Lemons
Wet Ingredients:
4 Eggs
125 ml (½ cup) Milk
Vanilla Paste or Liquid Vanilla (to taste)
¼ cup Lemon Juice (about 2-3 lemons)
220 g (1 cup) Softened Butter

Lemon Drizzle:
50 g (¼ cup) Sugar
50 g (¼ cup) Lemon Juice
3 tbsp Milk or Cream
1 tbsp Butter
You're absolutely right, I apologize for the mistake in the creaming process. Here's the corrected version with the butter incorporated differently:
Instructions:
Preheat the Oven: Start by preheating your oven to 180°C (350°F). This ensures the cake bakes evenly and rises beautifully.
Dry Ingredients First: In a large bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients: brown rice flour (or millet flour), tapioca starch, corn flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, sugar, and salt. The zest of 2 large lemons adds a fragrant citrus punch.
Cutting in the Butter: Using a fork, or your fingertips, work the softened butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. This creates air pockets that contribute to the cake's light and fluffy texture.
Wet Ingredients Unite: In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla extract (to taste), and lemon juice. Mix until well combined.
Bringing it All Together: Slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry mixture, mixing gently with a spatula until well combined without any lumps. 
Preparing the Baking Pan: Grease a baking dish of your chosen size (loaf pan, round cake pan, square pan – all work!). Parchment paper lining adds an extra layer of non-stick insurance.
Baking Time! Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, the cake is done!
The Magical Lemon Drizzle: While the cake cools slightly, prepare the lemon drizzle. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and lemon juice. Heat over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and whisk in the milk or cream and butter until smooth.
Drizzle with Love: Once the cake is cool enough to handle, generously drizzle the lemon drizzle over the top. This adds a beautiful glaze and an extra burst of citrusy flavor.
Slice & Savor! Cut the cake into slices and enjoy it plain, dusted with powdered sugar, or with a dollop of whipped cream.
​
Picture
Tips & Tricks:
Fresh is Best: Use fresh lemons for the best flavor. Bottled lemon juice can lack the vibrant zest and aroma of freshly squeezed lemons.
Room Temperature Matters: Ensure all your ingredients, especially the butter and eggs, are at room temperature. This promotes even mixing and a smooth batter.
Storage: Store leftover cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. The lemon drizzle will keep the cake moist, but refrigeration can dry it out slightly.
Freezing Option: For longer storage, you can freeze the cake for up to 3 months. Wrap the cooled cake tightly in plastic wrap and then again in aluminum foil. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before serving.

Conclusion:
This gluten-free lemon sponge cake is a delightful addition to your baking repertoire. It's light, airy, bursting with lemon flavor, and surprisingly easy to make. With its sunshine-y taste and vibrant citrus aroma, it's the perfect way to celebrate summer or brighten any day. So, gather your ingredients, preheat your oven, and get ready to bake a slice of sunshine!

Fear not, scone lovers! This recipe unlocks the secrets to creating delectable gluten-free scones that are just as delicious as their classic counterparts.

But wait, there's more! We've also included a simple and flavorful homemade strawberry jam recipe to complete your perfect afternoon tea experience. So, brew your favorite cuppa, gather your ingredients, and get ready to bake a batch of these gluten-free delights!

The Gluten-Free Scones:

Ingredients:
Dry Ingredients:
150 g Rice Flour (or Oat Flour)
100 g Tapioca Starch (or another starch like Potato Starch or Arrowroot Starch)
50 g Finely Milled Corn Flour
15 g Almond Meal
6 g Gluten-Free Baking Powder
2 g Xanthan Gum
5 g Salt
Wet Ingredients:
80 g Unsalted Butter, cold
100 g Milk (whole milk or your preferred dairy alternative)
1 Large Egg

Equipment:
Mixing Bowls (one large)
Baking Sheet
Parchment Paper
Sharp Knife or Pizza Cutter

The Art of Scone Making:
The Glorious Dry Mix:
Begin by whisking together all the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl. *Note: If you're using a store-bought gluten-free flour blend, ensure it already contains xanthan gum.
Butter Up:
Cut your softened butter into small cubes. Using a pastry cutter (or two knives), work the butter cubes into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. You want some pea-sized butter chunks remaining for that delightful scone texture.
Wet & Wonderful:
Gradually add the milk to the dry mix, and then the egg, and using a wooden spoon or your hands to gently combine. Don't overwork the dough! Just mix until it forms a soft, pliable ball.
Shaping the Scones:
Take your baking tray and line it with parchment paper and then take your dough and gently pat it down into a thick disc of a thickness of about 3-5 cm then cut the dough into 8 equal wedges, using a sharp knife or pizza cutter.
Baking Time!
Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F). Arrange the scones by leaving some space between them for even baking.
The Golden Touch:
Bake the scones for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown on top. Keep an eye on them, as baking times may vary slightly depending on your oven.
Scone Satisfaction:
Remove the scones from the oven and enjoy them warm or cooled as you prefer. ​

The Perfect Pairing: Homemade Strawberry Jam
While your scones cool, whip up a batch of this delightful homemade strawberry jam!

Ingredients:
500 g Fresh Strawberries, washed and hulled
200 g Granulated Sugar (or adjust to your taste preference)
1 tbsp Lemon Juice

Instructions:
Strawberry Symphony:
In a large saucepan, combine the strawberries and sugar. Using a potato masher or fork, gently mash some of the strawberries to release their juices.
Heat it Up:
Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a simmer.
Lemon Love:
Add the lemon juice and simmer for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the jam thickens to your desired consistency. You can test the thickness by placing a small spoonful on a chilled plate; if the jam wrinkles when you push it with your finger it's ready! Remove the jam from the heat and let it cool slightly.

Serving Suggestions: Once your scones are cool and your jam is ready, it's time to enjoy! Here are some classic serving suggestions for a delightful afternoon tea experience:
Warm or Cold: Scones are delicious warm or at room temperature.
Butter Up: Spread a generous pat of butter on your scone before adding a dollop of homemade strawberry jam.
Creamy Dream: Clotted cream, a thick and luxurious cream popular in British teatime tradition, adds another layer of decadence if you can find it.
Tea Time! Pair your scones with your favorite cup of tea for a quintessential British experience.​
Picture
Tips for Scone Success:
Use cold ingredients: This helps prevent the butter from melting too quickly during mixing, leading to lighter and flakier scones.
Don't overmix!: Overmixing the dough can result in tough scones. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.
Chill time (optional): For an even flakier texture, you can chill the dough for 30 minutes before shaping and baking.
Customize it!: Add a handful of chopped nuts, raisins, or chocolate chips to the dough for a fun twist.

With this recipe and these tips, you're well on your way to baking a batch of delightful gluten-free scones that rival the classics. Now, gather your ingredients, brew some tea, and get ready for a delicious afternoon tea experience!

Fork

Step-by-Step Guide to Baking Gluten-Free Peanut Butter Cookie Bliss:
Cream Together the Goodies:
In a large mixing bowl, cream together the peanut butter, sugar of your choice, and softened butter until smooth and well combined. Use a hand whisk to prevent adding too much air as the cookies may spread too much while baking.

Forming the Cookie Dough Balls:
Using a spoon or cookie scoop, portion the dough into roughly equal-sized balls. Gently roll each ball in your hands to smooth out the edges.
Shaping & Making the Crisscross Pattern:
Here comes the fun part! Place the cookie dough balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . Gently press down on each ball with a fork to flatten them slightly, creating a classic peanut butter cookie shape. Use the tines of the fork to make the signature crisscross pattern on top of each cookie, applying light pressure.
Optional Chocolate Fun: For those who love a chocolate surprise, gently press a chocolate chunk into the center of half of your cookie dough balls before flattening them. Fold the dough around the chocolate, making sure it's completely enclosed. Now, flatten and create the crisscross pattern as usual.
Baking Time!
Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Once preheated, bake the cookies for 15-20 minutes. The edges will be slightly golden brown, but the centers might still appear soft. That's okay! These cookies firm up as they cool.
Let Them Cool & Enjoy!
Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the cookies cool completely on the sheet before moving them. ​

Tips for Success:
Use room temperature ingredients for optimal creaming and even baking.
Space your cookies out on the baking sheet to allow for even heat distribution and prevent them from spreading into each other.
Let the cookies cool completely before storing them in an airtight container.

​Now, grab a glass of milk, savor these delicious gluten-free peanut butter cookies, and celebrate your baking success!

​Conquer Gluten-Free Pizza Night: A Neapolitan Dream Reimagined!

Imagine a pizza that transcends limitations. A pizza that captures the essence of Neapolitan tradition – a thin, crispy crust with a signature puffed edge (cornicione) and a light, airy interior – all while being entirely gluten-free. This recipe makes that dream a reality!

Neapolitan pizza is a culinary masterpiece, revered for its simplicity and focus on high-quality ingredients. Traditionally prepared with a specific type of flour and cooked in a scorching hot oven, achieving this iconic style gluten-free can seem like an impossible feat. But fear not! This recipe utilizes a unique blend of gluten-free flours and smart techniques to deliver a pizza that stays true to the Neapolitan spirit, with a delightful gluten-free twist.

The crust boasts a remarkable texture – crispy on the bottom, with a satisfying chew and a touch of airy lightness. It forms a beautiful base for a classic tomato sauce, topped with your favorite ingredients. For purists, there's the classic approach with a simple tomato sauce and mozzarella. But for the adventurous, I've included a shawarma chicken topping option, creating a unique fusion that brings the best of both worlds to your plate. I've even included a recipe for a refreshing yogurt-based tzatziki sauce to add a unique touch to your gluten-free Neapolitan masterpiece.

​So, are you ready to embark on this delicious journey?

Let's gather the ingredients and get started!

2. Combine Dry Ingredients:
In a large bowl, whisk together the rice flour (or your chosen alternative flour), tapioca starch, oat flour, sugar, instant yeast (if using active dry yeast see instructions above), and salt.

3. Add Wet Ingredients & Knead:
Add the warm water with apple cider vinegar, olive oil, and activated yeast mixture (if using) to the dry ingredients. Using a spoon or dough whisk, begin incorporating the wet ingredients into the dry mix. Once combined, knead for 5-7 minutes.
Tip: The dough will be slightly sticky at first. Resist the urge to add too much extra flour, as it can make the final crust tough. 

4. First Rise:
Form the dough into a ball, lightly oil it, and cover it with plastic wrap leaving it in the bowl. Let the dough rise in a warm spot for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.

5. Second rise: 
Once risen, gently deflate the dough and divide it into two equal balls. Place them on a clean baking mat or baking paper and let these rest for another 20-30 min on the counter covered with a clean kitchen towel.

6. Preheating the Oven:
While your dough is proofing for the second time, Preheat your oven to its highest setting (ideally around 250°C/480°F) with a baking stone or baking tray inside to create that nice puffed pizza edge.

7. Shaping the Pizza the Neapolitan Way:
Gently deflate the risen dough ball and place it on a lightly floured surface. Using the palms of your hands or your knuckles, begin to gently press and stretch the dough outwards from the center. Imagine pushing the dough away from you, not pulling it. Work your way around the dough, maintaining a light touch and applying even pressure to create a roughly circular shape of 20 cm in diameter. As you stretch outwards, focus on creating a thinner center and a slightly raised edge (cornicione) by gently pushing the dough outwards and upwards with your fingertips.


8. Transferring & Pre-Cooking the Base:
Brush your pizza base with some olive oil and carefully transfer your pizza base on the hot pizza stone or baking tray. Bake the pizza base for 10-12 minutes. This pre-cooking step helps crisp up the bottom crust before adding toppings.

9. Preparing the Tomato Sauce (Optional):
While the first pizza base pre-cooks, heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly. Remove from heat and set aside.

10. Assembling & Baking the Pizza:
Here's where you get creative with your toppings!
Remove the pre-cooked pizza base from the oven.
Spread a thin layer of your prepared tomato sauce (if using) over the base, leaving a small border around the edge.
Top with your desired cheese (shredded mozzarella works well), sliced peppers and onions, and shawarma chicken (shredded or chopped).
You can also add a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of dried oregano for extra flavor.

11. Final Bake:
Carefully transfer the assembled pizza back to the preheated oven (on the pizza stone or baking sheet). Bake for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the crust is golden brown.

11. Finishing Touches & Serving:
Once baked, remove the pizza from the oven. Let it cool slightly before slicing.

For an extra twist, drizzle with your homemade Yogurt Tzatziki Sauce (recipe below)!
Yogurt Tzatziki Sauce:
1 cup Plain Greek Yogurt
1/2 cup Chopped Cucumber, drained
1 tablespoon Olive Oil
1 clove Garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon Dried Dill
Salt & Pepper to taste
Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and stir well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.
Picture
Serving Suggestions:
Serve your gluten-free Neapolitan pizza hot, sliced into wedges.
Offer a variety of dipping sauces, such as marinara or pesto, for additional flavor.

Tips & Storage:
For a crispier crust, preheat your oven and pizza stone (or baking tray) to the highest setting possible.
Leftover pizza can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat in the oven or a toaster oven until warmed through and crispy.

This recipe unlocks the secrets to creating an authentic Neapolitan-style pizza, entirely gluten-free! Now you can experience the joy of a thin, crispy crust with a light and airy interior, all while enjoying your favorite toppings. So, gather your ingredients, unleash your inner pizzaiolo (pizza maker), and create a delicious gluten-free masterpiece!

​Unleash Your Inner Baker: Craft the Perfect Gluten-Free Rustic Loaf!

Craving a delicious, wholesome loaf of bread without the gluten? Look no further! This recipe unlocks the secrets to a magnificent Gluten-Free Rustic Bread – a dream come true for gluten-free bakers everywhere.
This rustic loaf boasts a beautiful texture, with a crisp crust and a soft, chewy interior. Made with a unique blend of gluten-free flours and psyllium husk powder, it achieves a satisfying structure without compromising on flavor. Unlike some gluten-free breads, this one doesn't require any fancy equipment – just a bowl, a rolling pin, and a little bit of patience.

This recipe isn't just for gluten-free bakers; it's for anyone who craves a homemade loaf that's easy to prepare yet delivers exceptional texture and flavor. Forget store-bought, dense gluten-free options. This recipe empowers you to create a show-stopping bread that rivals its wheat counterpart.

So, preheat your oven, gather your ingredients, and get ready to experience the joy of baking your own gluten-free masterpiece!

Ingredients (for one large loaf):

For the Dough:
100 g Brown Rice Flour
50 g Millet Flour (or additional Brown Rice Flour)
135 g Cornstarch, Tapioca Starch, or Potato Starch (choose one)
45 g Oat Flour 
20 g Psyllium Husk Powder (whole psyllium husk works too, but requires grinding)
370 ml Warm Water
10 ml Apple Cider Vinegar
20 g Sugar
7 g Instant Yeast
7 g Salt
20 g Olive Oil

For Brushing:
1 tbsp Olive Oil
Pastry Brush
Picture
A Step-by-Step Guide to Baking the Loaf:
Gather Your Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the brown rice flour, millet flour (or additional brown rice flour), cornstarch/tapioca starch/potato starch (whichever you choose), oat flour, instant yeast, sugar, salt, and psyllium husk powder. Mix well. 
Create a Tangy Base: In a separate bowl, combine the warm water and apple cider vinegar. This activates the yeast and adds a slight tang to the bread, mimicking the flavor profile of traditional wheat bread.
Unite Wet & Dry Ingredients: Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl containing the dry mix. Using a spoon or dough whisk, begin incorporating the wet ingredients into the dry. As the mixture comes together, you'll feel a slight resistance. This is normal! At this point, at your olive oil and keep working the dough with your hand until you get a homogenous dough ball that is not sticky to the touch and that comes off the sides of the bowl
Transform Dough into a Rustic Log: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Lightly flour your rolling pin. Roll out the dough into a large rectangle, aiming for approximately 30 cm long and 20 cm wide. Here comes the fun part! Imagine you're creating a jelly roll. ​​​​Starting from the wider end, gently fold the dough into a log. Press down gently to seal the seams. See video below:
Proofing: Time for the Dough to Rise: Transfer your dough log to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover the baking sheet loosely with a clean kitchen towel and find a warm spot for your dough to rise. Let it proof for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.
Preheat Oven: While your bread is proofing, preheat your oven to 220°C (425°F).
Scoring the Dough for a Perfect Rise: Once your dough has doubled in size, it's time to prepare it for baking. Use a sharp knife or a lame (a special bread scoring tool) to create diagonal slashes across the top of the loaf. These slashes allow steam to escape during baking, resulting in a beautiful rise and a rustic look.
Brushing: Brush the scored loaf generously with olive oil. This adds a touch of shine and helps create a crispy crust.
Baking: Bake the bread for 35-45 minutes, depending on your oven. Keep an eye on it during the last few minutes to ensure the crust doesn't burn.
Cooling & Slicing: Transfer the baked bread to a wire rack to cool completely. Resist the urge to slice into it right away! Patience is key for a clean and even slice.
​Enjoy & Get Creative! Now comes the best part – savor your delicious homemade Gluten-Free Rustic Bread! Toast it for breakfast, pair it with a hearty soup or salad for lunch, or create a gourmet sandwich experience. See serving suggestions below.


Knowing When Your Bread is Done:
The Look Test: The loaf should be a beautiful golden brown color on the outside.
The Thump Test: Carefully remove the bread from the oven and tap the bottom. It should sound hollow, indicating the bread is fully cooked through.

Serving Suggestions:
Classic Toasts: Enjoy your bread toasted with butter, jam, avocado, or your favorite toppings.
Bruschetta: Top toasted slices with olive oil, fresh tomatoes, garlic, and herbs for a simple and flavorful appetizer.
Grilled Cheese Bliss: Create a decadent grilled cheese sandwich using your gluten-free bread and your favorite cheese combination.
Italian Meatball Heaven: Build the perfect Italian meatball sub on slices of this rustic bread.

Tips for Success:
Use high-quality gluten-free flours for the best results.
Be patient during the proofing stage. Letting the dough rise properly ensures a good rise in the oven.
Enjoy your bread within 2-3 days for the best texture and flavor.

This Gluten-Free Rustic Bread recipe empowers you to create a show-stopping loaf that is not only delicious but also gluten-free. With its simple ingredients, detailed instructions, and focus on achieving the perfect texture, this recipe is ideal for both experienced and novice bakers. So, gather your ingredients, unleash your inner baker, and experience the joy of creating your own gluten-free masterpiece!

​The Ultimate Gluten-Free Vanilla Cheesecake: A Dream Come True

There's something undeniably comforting and luxurious about a perfectly baked cheesecake. Its creamy richness and delicate texture are a true indulgence. But for those following a gluten-free diet, this classic dessert can often feel out of reach. Fear not! This recipe unlocks the secret to a magnificent Gluten-Free Vanilla Cheesecake – a dream come true for cheesecake lovers everywhere.
This recipe utilizes a simple gluten-free digestive biscuit base for a sturdy and flavorful foundation. The creamy filling boasts a perfect balance of cream cheese, yogurt, and sugar, while cornstarch ensures a beautifully smooth and stable texture. No electric mixer is needed – a gentle hand whisk maintains air pockets for a light and fluffy cheesecake that avoids cracking. The result? A show-stopping dessert that is not only gluten-free but also incredibly rich, creamy, and absolutely delightful. This cheesecake is guaranteed to impress your guests, whether they follow dietary restrictions or simply adore a classic vanilla cheesecake done right!

Ingredients (for a large 20 cm cheesecake):

For the Base:
450 g Gluten-Free Digestive Biscuits (or any plain gluten-free biscuit of your choice)
150 g Melted Butter

For the Cheesecake Filling:
850 g Cream Cheese (full-fat or light, depending on your preference)
160 g Plain Yogurt (or vanilla yogurt)
200 g Granulated Sugar
20 g Cornstarch
4 Large Eggs
2 tsp Vanilla Extract (pure vanilla extract for the best flavor)

Optional Decorations:
Melted Chocolate (dark or milk chocolate, for drizzling)
Fresh Fruits (such as strawberries, cherries, or blueberries)

Equipment:
Food Processor (or a sturdy zip-lock bag and rolling pin)
Mixing Bowl
Whisk
20 cm Springform Pan
Parchment Paper
Small Glass (for pressing the crust)​
Picture
Method:
Preheat the Oven: Start by preheating your oven to 180°C (350°F). This temperature is ideal for baking the base and setting the initial stage for the cheesecake.
Prepare the Base:
Crush the Biscuits: If using a food processor, pulse the biscuits into fine crumbs. Alternatively, place the biscuits in a sturdy zip-lock bag and crush them with a rolling pin until finely ground.
Combine with Butter: Transfer the crushed biscuits to a mixing bowl. Pour the melted butter over the crumbs and mix well using a fork or spoon.
Texture Check: The mixture should resemble wet sand. If it feels too dry, add a little more melted butter, one tablespoon at a time, until you achieve the desired consistency.
Assemble the Crust:
Line the Pan: Line the bottom and sides of your springform pan with parchment paper for easy removal later.
Press the Crust: Transfer the biscuit crumb mixture to the prepared pan. Using your hands or the bottom of a small glass, firmly press the mixture evenly onto the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Aim for a compact and even crust with 3-5 cm borders.
Bake the Crust: Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake the crust for 10-12 minutes, or until it's golden brown.
Cooling Down: Remove the pan from the oven and let the crust cool completely before adding the filling.
Prepare the Cheesecake Filling:
Whisk the Cream Cheese & Yogurt: In a large mixing bowl, use a hand whisk (not an electric mixer) to gently whisk together the cream cheese and yogurt until smooth. Avoid over-mixing, as this can incorporate air bubbles that may cause cracks in the cheesecake later.
Sweeten & Thicken: Add the sugar and cornstarch to the cream cheese mixture and whisk until well combined.
Flavor & Eggs: Stir in the vanilla extract, then add the eggs one at a time, whisking well after each addition until fully incorporated. The resulting mixture should be smooth and slightly runny, but not overly liquid.
Pour the Filling: Pour the cheesecake filling over the cooled crust in the springform pan.​​​


Adjust Temperature & Bake: Reduce the oven temperature to 145°C (295°F) and bake the cheesecake for 1 hour.
Checking for Doneness: After 50 minutes of baking, check on the cheesecake. It should be mostly set with a slight jiggle in the center. The color should be a creamy white or slightly light gold. A gentle jiggle in the center is a good indication of doneness, but the cheesecake shouldn't be completely firm.
Cooling Process: Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the door slightly ajar for about an hour. This allows the cheesecake to cool gradually and prevents cracking.
Refrigerate & Set: Once the cheesecake has cooled completely, remove it from the oven and transfer it to the refrigerator. It needs to chill for at least 6 hours, but preferably overnight, to fully set and develop its perfect creamy texture and flavour.
Unmold & Decorate (Optional): Once chilled, remove the springform pan sides and the parchment paper.
Decorate & Serve: Now comes the fun part! Decorate your masterpiece with melted chocolate drizzled over the top, fresh fruits like strawberries, cherries, or blueberries, or any other toppings you desire.
Slice & Enjoy! Slice your beautiful Gluten-Free Vanilla Cheesecake and serve it cold. The perfect balance of creamy texture and rich vanilla flavor will surely leave you and your guests wanting more!
Picture
Tips:
For a richer cheesecake, use full-fat cream cheese.
Ensure all your ingredients are at room temperature before mixing for a smooth consistency.
Don't overbake the cheesecake. A slight jiggle in the center is ideal, as it will continue to set as it cools.
Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.

This Gluten-Free Vanilla Cheesecake recipe is a testament to the fact that delicious desserts can be enjoyed by everyone. With its simple ingredients, detailed instructions, and focus on achieving the perfect texture, this recipe empowers you to create a show-stopping dessert that is both delicious and gluten-free. So, gather your ingredients, preheat your oven, and get ready to experience the ultimate gluten-free cheesecake dream come true!

Eid al-Adha, a joyous festival marking the culmination of the Hajj pilgrimage, is a time for celebration and sharing with loved ones. In Morocco, this occasion is synonymous with delectable sweets, and among them shines the Ghriba – a melt-in-your-mouth almond cookie traditionally flavoured with orange blossom water.

This recipe takes the beloved Ghriba on a delightful adventure, transforming it into a Ghriba-Brownie. We combine the comforting flavors of the original with the rich decadence of a brownie, resulting in a soft, moist, and utterly irresistible treat. The orange blossom water adds a touch of Moroccan tradition, while the crinkled surface dusted with confectioners' sugar creates a visually stunning cookie, perfect for gracing your Eid al-Adha table.

This recipe is also gluten-free, ensuring everyone can enjoy a taste of this delightful fusion. So, gather your loved ones, preheat the oven, and get ready to create a batch of these delectable Ghriba-Brownies. They're guaranteed to be a showstopper at your Eid al-Adha celebration!

Ingredients (for approximately 18 cookies):

Dry Ingredients:
50 g Brown Sugar
50 g Granulated Sugar
75 g Oat Flour
25 g Almond Flour
55 g Cornstarch or Tapioca Starch
55 g Cocoa Powder
1 tsp Baking Powder
1/2 tsp Salt

Wet Ingredients:
115 g Melted Butter
2 Eggs
1 tsp Vanilla Extract

For Rolling the Cookies:
1 cup Powdered Sugar
1/2 cup Granulated Sugar
1/4 cup Orange Blossom Water (optional)

Instructions:
Prepare the Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients: brown sugar, granulated sugar, oat flour, almond flour, cornstarch (or tapioca starch), cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Ensure everything is evenly mixed and sifted for a smooth texture.
Combine the Wet Ingredients: In a separate bowl, using a hand mixer or whisk, beat together the melted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined and creamy.
Unite Wet and Dry: Slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing gently until a soft dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cookies tough.
Chill the Dough: Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 1 hour. This step helps the dough firm up and allows the flavors to meld, resulting in cookies that hold their shape better while baking.
Prepare the Rolling Station: Set up three separate shallow bowls for rolling the cookies. In one bowl, add the powdered sugar. In another, add the granulated sugar. In the last bowl (optional), add the orange blossom water.
Shape and Roll the Cookies: Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Take the chilled dough out of the refrigerator and wet your hands with the orange blossom water (if using). Scoop small to medium-sized portions of dough and roll them into balls.
Sugar Coating: First, roll each ball in the granulated sugar, coating it evenly. Then, roll it generously in the powdered sugar, ensuring a good covering. This creates the signature crinkled look and adds sweetness.
Bake the Cookies: Place the rolled cookies on the prepared baking sheet, leaving a little space between them for spreading. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the edges are set and the tops appear slightly cracked and crinkled. Don't overbake, as you want the inside to remain soft and moist.
Cool and Enjoy: Let the cookies cool completely on the baking sheet before transferring them to a wire rack to cool further. The cookies will firm up as they cool.
Eid Mubarak! Enjoy these delightful Ghriba-Brownies with a cup of Moroccan mint tea or coffee and celebrate Eid al-Adha with the joy of sharing delicious treats with loved ones.​



Tips:
For a richer chocolate flavor, use dark cocoa powder.
You can adjust the amount of orange blossom water based on your preference. Adding a few drops to the wet ingredients can also infuse the cookies with a subtle floral aroma.
Store leftover cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
​
Picture
Additional Tips:
These cookies are also perfect for gifting! Package them in a beautiful box or decorative tin for a delightful and thoughtful Eid al-Adha present.

A Culinary Journey to India: Unveiling the Secrets of Butter Chicken

3 Bay Leaves
2 Tbsp Cardamom Pods
1 Tbsp Cloves
1/2 Tbsp Black Peppercorns (adjust for desired spice level)
8-9 Pieces Cinnamon Bark
1/2 tsp Nutmeg (whole)
3-4 Tbsp Cumin Seeds
3-4 Tbsp Coriander Seeds
2 Tbsp Turmeric Powder
1 Tbsp Anise Seeds (optional)
1/2 tsp Fenugreek Seeds

For the Chicken & Sauce:
50 g Butter
1 Tbsp Olive Oil
1 Large Onion, Chopped
3 Garlic Cloves, Grated
1 Ginger Piece, Grated
4 Large Ripe Tomatoes, Freshly Chopped
2 Tbsp Garam Masala (from the recipe above)
1 Tbsp Paprika
1 Tbsp Turmeric
1 Tbsp Cumin
1 tsp Coriander Powder
1 tsp Cinnamon Powder
Salt to Taste
1 cup Water
1 (13.5 oz) Can Full-Fat Coconut Cream
1 Tbsp Tomato Concentrate
1 tsp Sugar
1 kg Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs or Breasts, Cut into Bite-Sized Pieces
3 Tbsp Greek Yogurt (lactose free or your preferred yogurt)
Juice of 1/2 Lemon
Fresh Cilantro, Chopped (for garnish)
Cooked Basmati Rice (for serving)

Method:

1. Make the Homemade Garam Masala:
In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast the bay leaves, cardamom pods, cloves, peppercorns, cinnamon bark, and anise seeds (if using) for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, until fragrant. Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Transfer the cooled spices and the remaining cumin seeds, coriander seeds, fenugreek seeds, and nutmeg to a spice grinder. Grind the spices into a fine powder. Store the leftover garam masala in an airtight container for future use.

2. Marinate the Chicken:
In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces with the Greek yogurt, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of the garam masala, grated ginger and garlic. Marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight.

3. Sauté the Aromatics:
Heat the butter and olive oil together in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until softened and translucent.
Stir in the grated garlic and ginger, and cook for another minute until fragrant.

4. Build the Sauce:
Add the chopped tomatoes, all the remaining ground spices (garam masala, paprika, turmeric, cumin, coriander powder, cinnamon powder), and salt to taste to the pot. Cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to develop.

5. Blend and Simmer:
Pour in the water and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes.
Using a hand blender, puree the sauce until smooth. This step ensures a rich and creamy texture.

6. Simmer and Thicken:
Stir in the coconut cream, tomato concentrate, and sugar. Increase heat to medium and simmer for another 10-15 minutes, or until the sauce thickens slightly.

7. Cook the Chicken:
While the sauce simmers, heat some olive oil in a separate pan over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken pieces and cook for 5-7 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through. You can also grill the chicken for a smoky flavor, if desired.

8. Finish the Dish:
Add the cooked chicken to the simmering sauce. Gently simmer for another 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

9. Serve and Enjoy!
Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro and serve hot over cooked basmati rice (see below how to cook the perfect basmati rice). Enjoy the symphony of flavors in this delicious Butter Chicken!
Picture

How to Cook Perfect Basmati Rice:

Basmati rice, known for its long, slender grains and fragrant aroma, perfectly complements the creamy butter chicken. Here's how to cook it:

Ingredients:
1 cup Basmati Rice
1 Water
1/2 tsp Salt
1 Tbsp Butter or Ghee (optional)

Method:
Rinse the basmati rice in a fine-mesh strainer under cold running water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch that can make the rice sticky.
In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed rice, water, and salt. If using, add the butter or ghee.
Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover the pot tightly with a lid, and simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and all the water has been absorbed.
Remove the pot from heat and let it stand for 5 minutes with the lid on. This allows the rice to steam and fluff up.
Fluff the rice gently with a fork and serve hot alongside your creamy butter chicken.

Tips:
Don't peek! Resist the urge to lift the lid while the rice is simmering. This allows the steam to stay trapped inside, resulting in perfectly cooked rice.

With these simple steps, you'll have fluffy and flavorful basmati rice to complete your delicious lactose-free butter chicken experience!

Storage Instructions:
Leftover butter chicken can be stored safely in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until warmed through.

Tip: The flavors of butter chicken often develop even more after a day of resting, so don't hesitate to make a big batch and enjoy it throughout the week. Leftovers can also be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating.

The Softest Gluten-Free Dream: Cinnamon Brioche Babka

Calling all gluten-free bakers! Are you craving a decadent treat that's both luxurious and light? Look no further than this Softest Gluten-Free Cinnamon Brioche Babka. This recipe captures the essence of classic babka, with a rich, buttery dough swirled with a fragrant cinnamon filling. But the magic lies in the gluten-free twist – a specially formulated blend of flours creates a texture so unbelievably soft and pillowy, you won't believe it's gluten-free!

This recipe is surprisingly easy to follow, even for novice bakers. Detailed instructions will guide you through every step, from mixing the dough to achieving the perfect babka twist. So, ditch the boxed mixes and get ready to impress everyone with your homemade gluten-free masterpiece!

Ingredients:
Dry Ingredients:
18 g Psyllium Husk 
150 g Tapioca Starch 
140 g Brown Rice Flour 
30 g Oat Flour
30 g Brown Sugar 
7 g Instant Yeast or Active Dry Yeast (see activation instructions below)
7 g Baking Powder 
5 g Xanthan Gum
Pinch of Salt
Wet Ingredients:
200 g Warm Water 
110 ml Warm Milk
1 Egg 
40 g Melted Butter 
For the Cinnamon Filling:
150 g Softened Butter (not melted)
150 g Brown Sugar 
3-4 tbsp Cinnamon Powder
For Brushing:
1/3 cup Milk
1 tbsp Honey or Maple Syrup (glaze and sweetness)
For Sugar Syrup (Optional but Recommended):
50 g Sugar
50 g Water​
Picture
Instructions:
Activate the Yeast (if using active dry yeast): In a small bowl, combine 1 teaspoon of sugar with 1 tablespoon of warm water. Stir in the yeast and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy. This activates the yeast and ensures it will properly leaven the dough.
Prepare the Filling: In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon powder until you get a smooth, spreadable paste. Set this aside.
Prep the Baking Pan: Line a loaf tin (approximately 25x15 cm) with parchment paper for easy removal.
Mix the Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients: psyllium husk, tapioca starch, brown rice flour, oat flour, sugar, baking powder, xanthan gum, and salt.
Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients: In another bowl, whisk together the warm water, warm milk, egg, and melted butter. Slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing with a dough whisk or a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook until a soft, slightly sticky dough forms. Tip: Resist the urge to add extra flour! Gluten-free doughs are naturally stickier than wheat doughs. The psyllium husk will absorb moisture and the dough will become less sticky as it rests.
Roll and Spread the Filling: On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a large rectangle, approximately 25x40 cm. Spread the prepared cinnamon filling evenly over the entire dough surface.
Shape the Babka: Starting from the long edge with the filling, carefully roll up the dough into a tight log. Pinch the seam closed to seal it. Using a serrated knife dipped in oil, carefully cut the log lengthwise in half, exposing the beautiful cinnamon swirl.
Create the Babka Twist: Now comes the fun part! Gently lay the two halves side-by-side, cut sides facing up. Carefully twist the two halves together, like braiding hair.
Transfer and Proof: Carefully transfer the twisted dough into your prepared loaf tin. Cover the loaf tin loosely with plastic wrap. Let the babka rise in a warm place for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until it doubles in size. The ideal temperature for rising is around 20-25°C (70-77°F). 
Preheat the Oven: While the babka is rising, preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
Egg Wash and Bake: In a small bowl, whisk together the milk and honey or maple syrup to create an egg wash. Brush the risen babka generously with the milk-honey wash. This will give your babka a beautiful golden brown color after baking.
Bake the Babka: Place the loaf tin in the preheated oven and bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour. The babka is done when it's golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean Tip: After 45 minutes, keep an eye on the babka. If the top starts to brown too quickly, you can tent a piece of aluminum foil over the top loosely to prevent burning.
Sugar Syrup (Optional but Recommended): While the babka bakes, prepare the sugar syrup. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture becomes clear. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.
Cool and Brush: Once baked, remove the babka from the oven and brush the top generously with the sugar syrup. This will give the babka a beautiful glossy sheen and a touch of extra sweetness. 
Slice and Serve: Let the babka cool until warm before slicing. Slice into thick slices and enjoy it warm or at room temperature. ​


Storage and Serving Suggestions:
Storage: This gluten-free babka is best enjoyed fresh. However, you can store it at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 2 days.
For an extra decadent treat: Serve your babka warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a drizzle of warm chocolate sauce.​​ ​

Recipe Details (Makes 12 Muffins):

Dry Ingredients:
110 g Rice Flour (or Millet Flour)
65 g Tapioca Starch (or Corn Starch/Potato Starch)
40 g Finely Milled Corn Flour
2 tsp Baking Powder
2 g Xanthan Gum
6 g Salt
1 tbsp Oregano (or Herbs of Choice)

Wet Ingredients:
4 Eggs
100 g Melted Butter
80 ml Milk (of choice)

Filling (Optional):
100 g Shredded Mozzarella Cheese (or Cheese of Choice)
300 g Cooked Mixed Veggies (see instructions below)

Instructions:
Preheat the Oven: Set your oven to 180°C (350°F) and grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
Prepare the Veggies (Optional): While the oven preheats, you can prepare your chosen vegetables. Here's how to create the caramelized onion, pepper, and scallion combination:
In a large skillet, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions, peppers, and scallions (around 1 medium onion, 1 bell pepper, and a handful of scallions, all chopped).
Season with a pinch of salt and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and caramelized.
Set the cooked vegetables aside to cool slightly.
Tip: Feel free to use a pre-made frozen veggie mix to save time. Simply thaw and drain any excess moisture before incorporating them into the batter.
Whisk the Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the rice flour (or millet flour), tapioca starch, corn flour, baking powder, xanthan gum, oregano (or your chosen herbs), and salt.
Combine the Wet Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, eggs, and milk until well combined.
Unite Wet and Dry: Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients and gently fold them together with a spatula until just combined. 
Incorporate the Goodies: Add the shredded cheese and cooked vegetables (if using) to the batter and fold them in gently until evenly distributed.
Fill the Muffin Tin: Divide the batter evenly among the greased muffin cups, filling them about 3/4 full.
Bake to Perfection: Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
Cool & Enjoy: Remove the muffins from the oven and let them cool in the muffin tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.​




​Tips & Storage:
Muffin Tin Magic: For perfectly shaped muffins, use a good quality non-stick muffin tin or line your regular muffin tin with paper liners.
Leftover Love: Store leftover muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. You can also refresh them by warming them in a microwave for a few seconds or toasting them in a preheated oven for a few minutes.
Freezing Option: For longer storage, allow the muffins to cool completely and then place them in a single layer on a baking sheet. Freeze for up to 3 months. When ready to enjoy, thaw overnight in the refrigerator or reheat from frozen in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for 10-15 minutes, or until warmed through.
