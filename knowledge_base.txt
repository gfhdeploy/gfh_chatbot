Ingredients:
Dry Ingredients:
150 g Brown rice flour
130 g Oat flour or sorghum flour
170 g Tapioca starch or potato starch or corn starch 
25 g Psyllium husk powder
35 g Sugar of your choice or honey
9 g Instant yeast (or 12 g active dry yeast)
9 g Salt
Cornflour or corn semolina for dusting (optional)
Wet Ingredients:
350-370 ml Warm water
130 ml Warm milk 
15 g Olive oil
15 g Apple cider vinegar ​

Instructions:
Combine Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the rice flour, oat flour, tapioca starch, psyllium husk powder, sugar, salt, and yeast.
Add Wet Ingredients: Gradually add the warm milk, then the olive oil, apple cider vinegar and warm water to the dry ingredients, mixing until a cohesive dough forms. The dough will be slightly sticky but not too much it should come off the sides of the mixing bowl. 
Knead the Dough: Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes, or until smooth. 
Shape the Muffins: Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball, then flatten slightly and bring all the edges towards the center like if you are closing something in. Then turn the dough seam-side down and roll it with your hand so as to seal tit and make a perfect spherical dough ball. Repeat for the rest of the dough balls. 
Proofing: Place the shaped muffins on a lightly greased baking sheet, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place for about 45-60 minutes, or until doubled in size.
Cook the Muffins: Preheat a large skillet or cast iron pan over medium heat. Dust the risen muffins with cornflour or corn semolina. Cook each muffin for 8-10 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through.
Cool and Serve: Let the muffins cool fully before serving. This is a very crucial step as it allows the crumb to set. Otherwise, you will find them gummy on the interior and sticky. ​

​Tip: For the perfect english muffin split, gently poke the middle with a fork all around. This technique preserves the iconic nooks and crannies, enhancing your experience (See video below).


Storage:
Store leftover muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2-3 days or in the fridge. I like to freeze them and reheat them when I want. I find that freezing them maintains the best texture and freshness when reheated. 

Serving Suggestions:
These gluten-free English muffins are perfect for breakfast, brunch, or a quick snack. Enjoy them toasted with butter and jam, or as the base for your favorite sandwich. They also pair well with soups and stews. Basically anything that needs a toasted piece of bread! They are delicious!

Reheating:
To reheat, split the muffin in half and toast it in a toaster or oven until warmed through and crispy. If frozen, defrost and then split in half. If you don't wish to split it, you can simply reheat it whole. 

By following these steps, you'll create delicious gluten-free English muffins that rival their traditional counterparts! Let me know in the comments what you think of this recipe 🥰

Combine Dry + Butter: In a large bowl, whisk together the rice flour, tapioca starch, corn flour, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum, and salt. Add butter to your dry ingredients and, with your hands, work it into the flours creating a crumbly batter that resembles breadcrumbs. This will make the muffins airier. 
Mix the Wet Ingredients : In a separate bowl, mix together the sugar and the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Now add your milk/yogurt and mix well.

Tips for Success:
Use room temperature ingredients for optimal results.

For a richer flavor, use high-quality chocolate chips.

Gluten-Free Pear Tatin: Easy Upside-Down Cake Recipe
21/7/20240 Comments
 
Picture
A Gluten-Free Twist on a French Classic: Pear Cake Tatin

The Tarte Tatin, a rustic French dessert featuring caramelized apples and a buttery pastry crust, has captivated palates for centuries. This iconic upside-down cake boasts a delightful juxtaposition of textures: a tender, slightly caramelized crust topped with soft, melt-in-your-mouth apples. But what if you're gluten-free? Fear not, baking enthusiasts! This recipe transforms the beloved Tarte Tatin into a stunning Pear Cake Tatin, offering a gluten-free rendition that retains all the flavor and charm of the original.

Pears, with their naturally sweet and juicy flesh, are arguably even more forgiving than apples when it comes to caramelization. Their delicate flavor complements the buttery sweetness of the caramelized base perfectly, and their soft texture pairs beautifully with the tender gluten-free cake batter.

This recipe utilizes a carefully chosen blend of gluten-free flours, including rice or millet flour, cornstarch, corn flour, and almond flour. This combination ensures a light and airy cake that holds its shape while baking. Additionally, xanthan gum acts as a binder, mimicking the gluten structure found in traditional wheat flour.

​So, are you ready to embark on a delightful gluten-free baking adventure? With just a few simple steps, you can create a showstopping Pear Cake Tatin that's sure to impress family and friends alike!
Picture
Ingredients: 

​For the Vanilla Cake Batter:
130 g Rice flour or Millet flour (can be substituted with a cup for cup gluten-free flour blend)
80 g Cornstarch or Tapioca starch or Potato starch
50 g Corn flour
40 g Almond flour, super finely milled
150 g Softened Butter
150 g Sugar of your choice (granulated, coconut, or a blend)
3 Eggs
100 ml Milk of choice (dairy, nut-based, or soy)
2 tsp Vanilla extract
2 tsp Baking powder
½ tsp Xanthan gum
Pinch of salt

For the Caramelized Pear Layer:
50 g Brown sugar
50 g Butter
2-3 Medium-sized pears, peeled
20 g Extra brown sugar for dusting the pears

Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
Prepare the Cake Batter: In a large bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients: rice flour, cornstarch, corn flour, almond flour, baking powder, xanthan gum, and salt.
Cream the Butter and Sugar: In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract and milk.
Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
Prepare the Baking Dish: Butter a round baking dish (approximately 30-40 cm in diameter). Line the bottom of the dish with parchment paper for easier removal later.
Caramelize the Sugar and Butter: In a saucepan over medium heat, melt together the 50g of brown sugar and 50g of butter until it becomes a golden brown liquid. Do not overcook, as it can become bitter.
Arrange the Pears: Pour the hot caramelized sugar mixture into the prepared baking dish. While the caramel is still warm, arrange the peeled pears decoratively over the bottom of the dish. You can slice them thinly lengthwise or cut them into thin wedges.
Sprinkle with Sugar: Lightly dust the arranged pears with the additional 20g of brown sugar.
Pour the Cake Batter: Carefully pour the prepared cake batter over the pears and caramelized base. Ensure the batter covers the pears evenly.
Bake the Cake Tatin: Bake the cake tatin in the preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for 30-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Cool and Flip: Let the cake cool completely in the baking dish before attempting to flip it. This allows the caramel to set and prevents the cake from falling apart.
The Big Reveal!: Once cool, carefully place a serving plate over the baking dish and, with a swift motion, flip the cake upside down. Gently remove the baking dish and peel away the parchment paper to reveal the beautiful caramelized pear layer. Enjoy!



​Serving Suggestions:
A Touch of Elegance: For a touch of elegance, dust the cake with powdered sugar before serving.
Whipped Cream Delight: A dollop of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream adds a delightful creamy contrast to the caramelized pears and the cake.
Warm Vanilla Sauce: For an extra decadent experience, drizzle the cake with a warm vanilla sauce.

Tips for Success:
Use Ripe Pears: Ripe pears will caramelize beautifully and have a more intense flavor. However, avoid pears that are too soft, as they can break down during baking.
Don't Overmix the Batter: Overmixing the cake batter can result in a tough cake. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.
Let it Cool Completely: Allowing the cake to cool completely before flipping is crucial. This ensures the caramel sets and prevents the cake from breaking apart.
Use a Springform Pan (Optional): For easier removal, consider using a springform pan. Line the bottom with parchment paper and grease the sides.

Storing and Reheating:
Store at Room Temperature: This cake is best enjoyed fresh. However, you can store leftovers at room temperature for up to 2 days, covered loosely with plastic wrap.
Reheating: Reheat individual slices in the microwave for a few seconds until slightly warmed through. Alternatively, reheat the entire cake in a preheated oven at 150°C (300°F) for 10-15 minutes, or until warmed through.

This Gluten-Free Pear Cake Tatin is a testament to the versatility of gluten-free baking. It offers a delicious and visually stunning dessert that rivals its traditional counterpart. With its light and airy cake, beautifully caramelized pears, and simple yet elegant presentation, this cake is sure to impress anyone who tries it. So next time you're craving a delicious gluten-free dessert, give this recipe a try! I encourage you to experiment and personalize this recipe. Feel free to use different types of pears, such as Bartlett or Bosc. You can also substitute the brown sugar with a different sweetener, like maple syrup or honey.

Gluten Free Italian Ciabatta Bread

Ciabatta: A Gluten-Free Tribute to Italy 🇮🇹

Ciabatta, the iconic Italian bread renowned for its airy, open crumb and chewy crust, has captivated bread lovers worldwide. While traditionally made with wheat flour, this gluten-free adaptation aims to capture the essence of this beloved bread, offering a taste of Italy without compromising dietary needs.

Hailing from the Lombardy region of Italy, ciabatta translates to "slipper" in English, a fitting name for its characteristic flat, oval shape. Traditionally, ciabatta is made with a high hydration dough, allowing for the development of large air pockets that contribute to its distinctive texture. While gluten plays a crucial role in the structure of traditional ciabatta, this gluten-free version relies on the careful balance of different flours and the addition of psyllium husk to achieve a similar result. The combination of rice flour, tapioca starch, and oat flour provides a sturdy foundation for the dough, while psyllium husk acts as a binding agent, helping to create a cohesive structure. The dough's high hydration level ensures a moist and chewy crumb, reminiscent of the original.

​So, gather your ingredients and embark on a culinary journey to Italy, gluten-free style!
Picture
Ingredients (for 6 Ciabatta Rolls):
Wet Ingredients:
400 ml Warm Water (around 100°F/38°C)
15 g Olive Oil
12 g Apple Cider Vinegar
Dry Ingredients:
15 g Psyllium Husk Powder
130 g Rice Flour
125 g Tapioca Starch (or Potato Starch, Corn Starch)
90 g Oat Flour
15 g Granulated Sugar
9 g Instant Yeast
9 g Salt
Equipment:
Large Mixing Bowl
Baking Sheet
Parchment Paper

Instructions:
Combine Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the psyllium, rice flour, tapioca starch, oat flour, sugar, instant yeast, and salt.
Create the Dough: Add the water, olive oil, apple cider vinegar to the dry ingredients. Kneed well for 5-7 min until a smooth slightly sticky dough forms.
Shape the Dough: Turn the dough out onto a generously floured surface, roll it into a rectangle of about 25x20 cm with the help of a rolling pin. Divide your rectangle into 6 roughly equal smaller rectangular pieces. 
Rise: Place the shaped ciabatta breads bottom side up (so that the side with the flour is facing up for that traditional ciabatta look) on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving enough space between them. Cover with a clean cloth in a warm place and let them rise for 45 minutes to 1h, or until doubled in size.
Baking: Preheat your oven to 430°F (220°C). To create steam, spritz the inside of the oven with water or place a tray of ice cubes in the bottom of the oven before baking. Bake the ciabatta breads for 20-25 minutes. 
Cooling and Enjoying: Let the ciabatta cool completely on a wire rack before slicing and enjoying.​

​Tips for Success:
Don't be afraid of a sticky dough; this is characteristic of ciabatta.
Create steam in the oven for a crispy crust.
Let the ciabatta cool completely before slicing to prevent a gummy texture.

Your homemade gluten-free ciabatta is best enjoyed fresh, with its crisp crust and soft, airy interior. However, if you have leftovers, store them in a paper bag at room temperature for up to two days. To revive the crust, briefly reheat the ciabatta in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for a few minutes. This gluten-free ciabatta is a versatile bread that can be enjoyed in countless ways. Slice it and toast it for breakfast with your favorite jam or avocado. Use it as a base for sandwiches or bruschetta. Or simply savor it on its own, drizzled with olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt.

Gluten Free Chocolate Vienna Bread (Baguette Viennoise)

A Viennese Affair: Baking the Perfect Baguette Viennoise (Gluten-Free!)

Ah, Vienna! The City of Music, waltzes, and of course, delectable pastries. But Vienna's culinary tapestry extends beyond the ornate cakes and decadent chocolates. Enter the Baguette Viennoise, a seemingly simple yet utterly satisfying bread that bridges the gap between a classic French baguette and a soft, enriched loaf.
This delightful creation boasts a golden crust that yields to a soft, airy interior, sometimes dotted with chocolate chips or studded with raisins. Unlike its namesake, the French baguette, the Baguette Viennoise is enriched with ingredients like eggs and milk, resulting in a richer flavor and a more forgiving texture. It's a breakfast staple in Vienna, enjoyed on its own or slathered with butter and jam.

But what if you can't indulge in gluten? Fear not, baking enthusiasts! This recipe unlocks the magic of the Baguette Viennoise for those who follow a gluten-free diet. By utilizing a carefully crafted blend of gluten-free flours and psyllium husk powder, we can achieve a texture and flavor that rivals the original, all without compromising on dietary needs.

​So, grab your mixing bowls and preheat your oven, because we're about to embark on a delightful journey to Vienna, one delicious Baguette Viennoise at a time!

The Secret Lies in the Dough:
The key to achieving success in this recipe is the enriched gluten-free dough. Unlike basic gluten-free breads, enriched doughs incorporate ingredients like eggs, milk, and butter, resulting in a richer, more flavorful, and importantly, softer texture. This recipe utilizes a carefully balanced blend of gluten-free flours and psyllium husk powder to mimic the structure and chew of regular wheat flour, while the enriched ingredients create a luxurious mouthfeel that rivals any traditional viennoise.
Picture
Ingredients (Makes 10 Mini Viennoise au Chocolat):

Dry Ingredients:
19 g Psyllium Husk
165 g Tapioca Starch
140 g Brown Rice Flour
30 g Oat Flour
90 g Brown Sugar (or other sugar of your choice)
9 g Active Dry Yeast
7 g Baking Powder
5 g Xanthan Gum
Pinch of Salt
Wet Ingredients:
200 g Warm Water (105°F / 41°C)
100 ml Warm Milk (105°F / 41°C)
1 Egg + 1 Egg Yolk
40 g Melted Butter
For Brushing:
1/3 cup Milk
1 tbsp Honey or Maple Syrup
1 tsp Cocoa Powder
25 g Melted Butter (for after baking)

Instructions:
Gather Your Ingredients: Prepare all your ingredients and preheat your oven to 290°F (143°C).
Dry Mix Magic: In a large bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients: psyllium husk, tapioca starch, brown rice flour, oat flour, sugar, yeast, baking powder, xanthan gum, and salt.
Wet & Combine: In a separate bowl, whisk together the warm water, warm milk, egg, egg yolk, and melted butter.
Dough Time: Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a soft, sticky dough forms. Don't worry about adding too much extra flour, as this can make your viennoise dry. Use a spatula to help bring the dough together.
Chocolatey Delight: Once the dough is well combined, gently fold in your chocolate chips (or other desired fillings like raisins).
A Gentle Knead: Lightly flour a clean surface and transfer the dough. With floured hands, gently knead the dough for a minute or two, just until it forms a cohesive ball and loses some of its stickiness. Don't overwork the dough or incorporate too much flour.
Shaping Up: Shape the dough into a long log. Divide the log into 10 equal pieces using a knife or dough scraper.
Forming the Baguettes: Take one dough piece at a time and flatten it slightly with your hands. Roll it up tightly into a log shape, ensuring the chocolate chips are evenly distributed within. Seal the edges by pinching the seam shut. Place the shaped viennoise seam-side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Repeat for all dough pieces.
Rise: Cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and let the viennoise rise in a warm spot for 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.
Brushing: In a small bowl, whisk together the milk, honey or maple syrup, and cocoa powder. Once the baguettes have risen, gently brush the tops with the mixture for a beautiful golden brown color.
Scoring & Baking: Using a sharp knife or a baking lame (a special tool for scoring bread), carefully make three diagonal incisions on the top of each viennoise. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.
Golden Perfection: Remove the viennoises from the oven and brush them immediately with the melted butter you prepared earlier. This final brush adds a touch of shine and creates a softer crust.
Enjoy!​​​


Storage & Reheating:
These vienna baguettes are best enjoyed fresh, but they can be stored for up to 2 days at room temperature in an airtight container.
To reheat, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Wrap the viennoise in aluminum foil and heat for 5-7 minutes, or until warmed through.

Tips for Success:
Warm Ingredients: Ensure your water and milk are warm but not hot (around 105°F / 41°C) to activate the yeast.
Scoring Tip: Don't cut too deeply when scoring – a slight incision is enough.

Enjoy these delicious Gluten-Free Viennoises au Chocolat! They're a perfect treat for breakfast, a delightful snack, or even a special dessert.

Feel free to experiment with different fillings! Chopped nuts, cinnamon and sugar, or even a fruit jam filling would be fantastic alternatives.

​A Taste of Morocco: Kabab Maghdour - The "Betrayed Kebab" Stew

Embark on a culinary journey to Morocco with Kabab Maghdour, a deceptively simple yet incredibly flavorful stew. Literally translating to "Betrayed Kebab," this dish offers a delightful twist on the classic grilled kebab. Unlike its skewered cousin, Kabab Maghdour features tender, cubed meat simmered in a rich and aromatic broth, creating a comforting and satisfying meal.

The origins of the name "Betrayed Kebab" are shrouded in a bit of mystery. Some believe it refers to the fact that the meat isn't grilled but rather stewed. Others suggest it might signify the absence of vegetables, a typical accompaniment to kebabs. Regardless of the origin story, Kabab Maghdour remains a beloved staple in Moroccan households, cherished for its simplicity and incredible flavor.
​
Here's the beauty of Kabab Maghdour: it's a weeknight lifesaver! This recipe requires minimal prep and utilizes a pressure cooker to deliver a melt-in-your-mouth meat dish in under 45 minutes. No soaking, marinating, or extensive chopping is needed. Simply throw all the ingredients together, and your pressure cooker does the rest of the work, transforming them into a fragrant and delicious stew.
So, ditch the takeout menus and embrace the convenience of Kabab Maghdour. It's perfect for busy weeknights, meal prepping, or simply satisfying a craving for authentic Moroccan flavors.

Salt & Black Pepper (to taste)
2 Beef Stock Cubes
2 tbsp Tomato Paste
1.5 cups Water
Equipment:
Pressure Cooker
Large Spoon
Serving Platter
Instructions:
Prep is a Breeze: The beauty of this recipe lies in its simplicity. There's no need for extensive chopping or prep work. Simply dice your chosen cut of meat into bite-sized pieces. Leaner cuts are ideal for this stew, as excess fat can make the dish greasy.
Flavor Fusion in the Pot: In your pressure cooker, combine the diced meat with all the remaining ingredients: butter, olive oil, paprika, cumin, salt, pepper, stock cubes, tomato paste, and water.
Pressure Cooker Magic: Close the pressure cooker securely and ensure the pressure release valve is set to "seal." Here's the key to perfect Kabab Maghdour:
Cook on high pressure for 30 minutes after the pressure valve reaches full pressure (indicated by a whistle or jiggle).
After 30 minutes, carefully release the pressure using the quick release method according to your pressure cooker's instructions.
Second Whistle for Tenderness: Once the pressure is released, open the pot and check the meat's tenderness. If it's still a bit firm, simply close the pressure cooker again, bring it back up to pressure, and cook for another 15-20 minutes (one additional whistle).
This extra cooking time ensures the meat is melt-in-your-mouth tender and allows the sauce to thicken further.
Serving Up Moroccan Magic: Once your Kabab Maghdour is cooked through and the sauce has reached your desired consistency, it's ready to serve! Spoon the stew onto a bed of fluffy white rice or other. Alternatively, enjoy it with some warm, crusty bread for dipping into the flavorful sauce.​

Tips for a Delicious Kabab Maghdour:
Spice it Up: For a touch of heat, add a pinch of cayenne pepper or a teaspoon of harissa paste along with the other spices.
Garnish Delight: For a touch of Moroccan flair, garnish your Kabab Maghdour with chopped fresh cilantro or parsley.
Leftover Love: This stew reheats beautifully. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

​Embrace the Simplicity and Savor the Flavor:
Kabab Maghdour is a testament to the power of simple ingredients and bold flavors. With minimal prep and the magic of a pressure cooker, you can create a restaurant-worthy Moroccan stew in less than an hour. So, gather your ingredients, turn on your pressure cooker, and embark on a culinary adventure to Morocco with this delightful Kabab Maghdour recipe!

Step-by-Step Guide to Gluten-Free Bomboloni Bliss:
Gather Your Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the brown rice flour, corn starch, oat flour, psyllium husk powder, sugar, instant yeast, xanthan gum, salt, and baking powder.
Add the Wet Ones: Add the milk and water to the dry ingredients along with the egg and butter. 
Mix it Up: Using an electric mixer (optional) or a sturdy spoon, mix all the ingredients together until a soft, slightly sticky dough forms. Don't worry, this stickiness is normal!
Chilling Time: Transfer the dough to a clean bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight. Chilling allows the flours to absorb the liquids fully, resulting in a less sticky dough for easier handling later.
Divide & Conquer: After chilling, remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.
Shape the Doughnuts: Take one piece of dough and gently flatten it gently into a circle about 1/4-inch thick. Take the edges and bring them towards the center like if you have a filling you are trying to enclose. Seal all the edged in the middle, then flip your doughnut ball and, with with your hand enclosing the doughnut make circular movements so as to create the perfect and smooth dough ball. Repeat for the rest of the dough balls. 
Parchment Paper Magic: Cut squares of parchment paper large enough to comfortably hold each doughnut. Place each shaped doughnut on a separate parchment paper square. This will make frying and handling much easier.
Second Rise: Cover the doughnuts with a clean kitchen towel and let them rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.
Cinnamon Sugar Symphony: While the doughnuts rise, prepare your cinnamon sugar coating by mixing the sugar and cinnamon in a shallow bowl.
Heating Up the Oil: Fill a deep fryer or large pot with enough high smoke point oil (like canola, sunflower, or refined coconut oil) to reach a depth of at least 3 inches. Heat the oil over medium heat to around 350°F (175°C). You can check the oil temperature with a kitchen thermometer for accuracy. 
The magic of parchment paper: Carefully lift a doughnut (with its parchment paper square) and gently slide it into the hot oil. The parchment paper will detach easily once the doughnut starts to cook. Don't overcrowd the pot: Fry the doughnuts in batches of 2-3 at a time, depending on the size of your pot. Overcrowding can lower the oil temperature and result in greasy doughnuts.
Golden Perfection: Fry the doughnuts for 2-3 minutes per side, or until they are golden brown all over.
Out they come!: Once golden brown, use a slotted spoon to remove the doughnuts from the oil and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
Cinnamon Sugar Bliss: While the doughnuts are still warm, but not too hot to handle, roll them one at a time in the cinnamon sugar mixture, coating them generously.
Cooling Down: Let the doughnuts cool completely on a wire rack before filling them.
Filling Fun: Time to unleash your creativity! You can fill your bomboloni with your favorite jams (apricot, strawberry, etc.), melted chocolate, or even a combination of both.
Here's how to fill them neatly: Use a sharp knife to make a small incision on the side of each cooled doughnut. Fill a piping bag or syringe with your chosen filling and carefully pipe it into the doughnut through the incision.
Now, the moment you've been waiting for! Bite into your homemade gluten-free bomboloni and savor the soft, pillowy texture bursting with flavor. The combination of the fluffy dough, the sweet cinnamon sugar coating, and the delicious filling is a taste of summer magic, no matter the season


Tips for Success:
Use room temperature ingredients: This ensures even mixing and a smooth dough.
​The magic of chilling: Chilling the dough is crucial for a less sticky dough and easier handling.
Oil temperature matters: Ensure the oil is hot enough to fry the doughnuts properly, but not too hot to burn them.
Don't overcrowd the pot: This will prevent even cooking and lower the oil temperature.

Enjoy these delicious gluten-free bomboloni and share them with your loved ones!

There you have it! These delightful gluten-free bomboloni are a delicious way to bring back those summer vibes, no matter the season. Filled with your favorite jams, chocolate, or a delightful combination of both, and coated in a sweet cinnamon sugar symphony, they're a treat for the taste buds and a testament to the magic of homemade baking.

Storage and Reheating Tips:
These bomboloni are best enjoyed fresh, but you can store them for later if needed. Here's how:
Store at room temperature: Once the doughnuts have cooled completely, store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. The cinnamon sugar coating will soften slightly, but the doughnuts will still be delicious.
Fridge for longer storage: For longer storage (up to 3 days), place the cooled doughnuts in an airtight container and store them in the refrigerator. The texture will become a bit firmer, but they can be easily revived.
Reheating magic: To reheat your stored bomboloni, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Place the doughnuts on a baking sheet and warm them for 5-7 minutes, or until slightly warmed through. This will revive their softness and make the cinnamon sugar coating a bit crispier.

Feel free to experiment with different fillings! Nutella, cream, or even a sprinkle of powdered sugar are all fantastic options.

So, the next time you're craving a sweet treat, whip up a batch of these gluten-free bomboloni and share them with your loved ones. They're guaranteed to bring back happy memories and create new ones!

Whisk the Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients: rice flour (or oat flour), tapioca starch, corn flour, almond flour (if using), sugar, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum, and salt. Add the butter to your dry ingredients and whisk it into the flours until you get a crumbly texture. 
Wet Ingredients: Add the milk, yogurt, eggs, and vanilla extract to a separate bowl and whisk until well combined.
Dry Meets Wet: Now, it's time to combine the wet and dry ingredients! Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, whisking gently until just combined. Don't overmix!

Baking Time!: Bake your muffins for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The baking time may vary slightly depending on if you're using fresh or frozen berries. Fresh berries will bake a bit faster.
