​Gluten-Free Sesame Bread Buns: A Classic Reinvented

Remember the joy of biting into a freshly baked sesame seed bun, its crust yielding to a soft, pillowy interior? For those with gluten sensitivities, this classic treat has often been a distant memory. But fear not, bread enthusiasts! This recipe is here to change that. I've meticulously crafted a gluten-free bun that captures the essence of the original, delivering a satisfying crunch and a tender, flavorful crumb. By combining the right balance of gluten-free flours and employing expert baking techniques, I've created a bun that's not only delicious but also incredibly versatile. Whether you're building a towering burger, crafting a classic BLT, or simply enjoying it toasted with butter, these buns will elevate your meal to new heights.

Let's embark on a baking adventure and create these irresistible gluten-free sesame seed buns together.

Ingredients for 8 Buns:
Dry Ingredients:
1.5 cups Rice Flour or Millet Flour
1.5 cups Oat Flour or Sorghum Flour
1.5 cups Tapioca Starch or Potato Starch
1.5 tsp Instant Yeast
3 tsp Psyllium Husk Powder
1 tsp Salt
2 tsp Sugar
1 tbsp Olive Oil
​​
For Coating:
1 cups Sesame Seeds
1 egg
1 tbsp Milk

Why the Eggwash?

It serves several purposes:
Golden brown finish: The egg wash helps to create a beautiful, golden-brown crust on the baked goods. The sugars in the egg caramelize during baking, resulting in a desirable appearance. The combination of egg and milk produces a deeper, more golden-brown color on the baked goods compared to using egg alone.
Enhanced flavor: While subtle, the egg wash can add a slight richness and depth of flavor to the finished product.
Improved texture: The egg wash helps to create a crisp exterior while maintaining a soft interior in breads and rolls. A small amount of milk can help prevent the baked goods from drying out, ensuring a softer texture.
Adhesion: For items with toppings, such as sesame seeds or poppy seeds, the egg wash acts as a glue to help them adhere to the surface.
Enhanced shine: The addition of milk creates a glossier finish on the baked goods.

​While it's possible to use just egg or milk alone for an egg wash, the combination of both typically yields the most desirable results in terms of color, shine, and texture. In the case of our gluten-free sesame bread buns, the egg wash enhances the golden brown color of the sesame seeds and helps them stick to the surface, creating a visually appealing and flavorful finish.

Instructions:
Combine Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the rice flour, oat flour, tapioca starch, instant yeast, psyllium husk powder, salt, and sugar.
Add Wet Ingredients: In a separate bowl, combine the warm water and olive oil. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a cohesive dough forms. The dough will be slightly sticky.  
Knead the Dough: Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.
Shape the Buns: Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball by flattening them and then bringing the sides towards the center, then roll to seal the seam on the bottom of your dough ball. See the video below for clarity.
Proofing: Place the shaped buns on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, cover with a plastic wrap and a clean kitchen cloth, and let rise in a warm place for about 45-60 minutes, or until doubled in size.
Prepare the Egg Wash: In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and milk for the egg wash.
Coat the Buns: Brush the risen buns with the egg wash and sprinkle generously with sesame seeds.
Bake: Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Bake the buns for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.
Cool and Serve: Let the buns cool completely on a wire rack before slicing and enjoying.​

Tips:
Experiment with different seed toppings, such as poppy seeds or everything bagel seasoning.
Store leftover buns in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2-3 days.
For longer storage, freeze your buns and simply reheat them in the oven for 7-10 min at 350°F (180°C)

Enjoy your homemade gluten-free sesame bread buns!

Get ready to elevate your breakfast or dessert game with these homemade gluten-free cinnamon swirls. Serve them warm with a cup of coffee or tea, or enjoy them as a sweet snack throughout the day.​
Picture
Ingredients:
For the Gluten-Free Brioche Dough:
140 g Rice flour
160 g Tapioca starch or other starch of choice
30 g Oat flour
18 g Psyllium husk
70 g Brown sugar
8 g Instant yeast
8 g Baking powder
6 g Xanthan gum
5 g Salt
160 g Warm water
140 g Warm milk
1 Egg
50 g Melted butter

For the Cinnamon Filling:
120 g Soft butter
100 g Sugar of choice (dark brown sugar and coconut sugar recommended)
3 tbsp Cinnamon powder
1 tbsp Vanilla extract

For the Greek Yogurt Icing:
2 cups Greek yogurt
1 cup Powdered sugar
1 tsp Vanilla extract
Picture
Instructions:
Prepare the Dough: In a large bowl, combine the rice flour, tapioca starch, oat flour, psyllium husk, sugar, yeast, baking powder, xanthan gum, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the warm water, warm milk, egg, and melted butter. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a soft, sticky dough forms.
Create the Filling: In a small bowl, cream together the softened butter, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy.
Assemble the Swirls: Roll out the dough into a large rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick. Spread the cinnamon filling evenly over the dough. Starting from one long side, tightly roll up the dough into a log. Use a sharp knife to cut the log into 12 even slices. Place the slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, cut-side up. Another method is to cut the rectangle intro 12 stripes and roll each stripe on its own. I prefer this method as its easier to do and mess free! 
Let Rise: Cover the cinnamon swirls with plastic wrap and let them rise in a warm place for about 45-60 minutes, or until doubled in size.
Preheat and Bake: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the cinnamon swirls for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.
Prepare the Icing: While the cinnamon swirls are baking, combine the Greek yogurt, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract in a small bowl.
Assemble and Serve: Let the cinnamon swirls cool slightly before frosting. Drizzle the Greek yogurt icing over the warm swirls. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.
Tips:
For a richer flavor, use a combination of dark brown sugar and coconut sugar in the filling.
You can adjust the sweetness of the icing by adding more or less powdered sugar to taste.
For extra flavor, add a pinch of nutmeg or cardamom to the filling.

​These gluten-free cinnamon swirls are a delightful treat that can be enjoyed for breakfast, dessert, or as a snack. Enjoy!

Traditionally, English muffins are cooked on a griddle or skillet, resulting in a crisp exterior and a soft, tender interior.  

The English muffin has long been a challenge for those following a gluten-free diet. Traditional methods often result in dense, flavorless alternatives that fail to capture the essence of the original. However, this recipe offers a groundbreaking approach, delivering a gluten-free English muffin that is as satisfying and delicious as its traditional counterpart. By carefully selecting gluten-free flours and optimizing the baking process, this muffin boasts a perfect balance of texture and taste.

Ingredients:
Dry Ingredients:
150 g Brown rice flour
130 g Oat flour or sorghum flour
170 g Tapioca starch or potato starch or corn starch 
25 g Psyllium husk powder
35 g Sugar of your choice or honey
9 g Instant yeast (or 12 g active dry yeast)
9 g Salt
Cornflour or corn semolina for dusting (optional)
Wet Ingredients:
350-370 ml Warm water
130 ml Warm milk 
15 g Olive oil
15 g Apple cider vinegar ​

Instructions:
Combine Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the rice flour, oat flour, tapioca starch, psyllium husk powder, sugar, salt, and yeast.
Add Wet Ingredients: Gradually add the warm milk, then the olive oil, apple cider vinegar and warm water to the dry ingredients, mixing until a cohesive dough forms. The dough will be slightly sticky but not too much it should come off the sides of the mixing bowl. 
Knead the Dough: Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes, or until smooth. 
Shape the Muffins: Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball, then flatten slightly and bring all the edges towards the center like if you are closing something in. Then turn the dough seam-side down and roll it with your hand so as to seal tit and make a perfect spherical dough ball. Repeat for the rest of the dough balls. 
Proofing: Place the shaped muffins on a lightly greased baking sheet, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place for about 45-60 minutes, or until doubled in size.
Cook the Muffins: Preheat a large skillet or cast iron pan over medium heat. Dust the risen muffins with cornflour or corn semolina. Cook each muffin for 8-10 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through.
Cool and Serve: Let the muffins cool fully before serving. This is a very crucial step as it allows the crumb to set. Otherwise, you will find them gummy on the interior and sticky. ​

​Tip: For the perfect english muffin split, gently poke the middle with a fork all around. This technique preserves the iconic nooks and crannies, enhancing your experience (See video below).


Storage:
Store leftover muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2-3 days or in the fridge. I like to freeze them and reheat them when I want. I find that freezing them maintains the best texture and freshness when reheated. 

Serving Suggestions:
These gluten-free English muffins are perfect for breakfast, brunch, or a quick snack. Enjoy them toasted with butter and jam, or as the base for your favorite sandwich. They also pair well with soups and stews. Basically anything that needs a toasted piece of bread! They are delicious!

Reheating:
To reheat, split the muffin in half and toast it in a toaster or oven until warmed through and crispy. If frozen, defrost and then split in half. If you don't wish to split it, you can simply reheat it whole. 

By following these steps, you'll create delicious gluten-free English muffins that rival their traditional counterparts! Let me know in the comments what you think of this recipe 🥰

Gluten Free Mini Zaatar and Olive Harsha (Moroccan Semolina Flatbread)
29/8/20240 Comments
 
Picture
Embark on a culinary journey to the vibrant streets of Morocco with this gluten-free twist on a classic favorite: Mini Zaatar and Olive Harsha. Traditionally made with semolina, this version uses finely milled corn flour, making it perfect for those following a gluten-free lifestyle without compromising on taste or texture.

Harsha, a beloved Moroccan flatbread, is typically enjoyed as a breakfast staple or a comforting snack. My gluten-free adaptation maintains the authentic crispy exterior and soft, slightly sweet interior that harsha is known for. The addition of zaatar, an aromatic Middle Eastern spice blend, and briny black olives elevates this dish to new heights, creating a harmonious fusion of flavors that dance on your palate.

The corn flour base provides a subtle sweetness and a delightful crunch, while the zaatar brings a complex blend of herbs and sesame seeds that transport you straight to the bustling souks of Marrakech. The olives add a savory depth, balancing the sweetness and creating a well-rounded flavor profile that's sure to impress.

Whether you're gluten-intolerant, celiac, or simply looking to explore new culinary horizons, these Mini Zaatar and Olive Harshas are a must-try. They're perfect for breakfast, as an appetizer, or even as a unique side dish for your next dinner party. Let's dive into this gluten-free adventure and bring a taste of Morocco to your kitchen.
Picture
Ingredients for 8 mini harshas:

- 1 1/2 cups finely milled corn flour (not the coarse kind)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 2 tablespoons sugar of choice (or honey)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 50 grams (about 3 1/2 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted
- 1/2 - 3/4 cup warm milk of choice (adjust as needed)

For the toppings:
- 1 tablespoon zaatar spice mix
- 1/2 cup pitted black olives, roughly chopped

Method:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the corn flour, baking powder, sugar (if using), and salt. Whisk together to ensure even distribution of the dry ingredients.

2. Pour the melted butter over the dry ingredients. Using your fingers or a fork, work the butter into the flour mixture until you achieve a crumbly texture, similar to wet sand.

3. Gradually add the warm milk, starting with 1/2 cup. Mix with a wooden spoon or your hands, adding more milk as needed. The goal is to create a dough that's moist enough to form patties but not overly wet. It should hold together when pressed.

4. Once you've reached the right consistency, add the zaatar spice mix and chopped olives to the dough. Gently fold them in, ensuring even distribution throughout the mixture.

5. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. With slightly damp hands, shape each portion into a small patty, about 2-3 inches in diameter and 1/2 inch thick.

6. Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-low heat. You don't need to add any oil, as the butter in the dough will prevent sticking.

7. Place the harsha patties onto the heated surface, leaving some space between each one. Cook for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until they develop a golden-brown crust and are cooked through.

8. Carefully flip the harshas and cook for another 5-7 minutes on the other side. They should be crispy and browned on both sides when done.

9. Remove from the heat and let them cool slightly on a wire rack to maintain their crispiness.
Picture
Storage and Serving Suggestions:

Storage:
- These gluten-free harshas are best enjoyed fresh, but they can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.
- For longer storage, keep them in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
- To freeze, place cooled harshas in a freezer-safe container, separating layers with parchment paper, and freeze for up to 1 month. Thaw at room temperature and reheat before serving.

Serving Suggestions:
- Serve your Mini Zaatar and Olive Harshas warm or at room temperature.
- For a traditional Moroccan experience, pair them with a steaming cup of mint tea.
- Drizzle with honey for a delightful sweet and savory combination.
- Serve alongside your favorite soft cheese, such as labneh or cream cheese.
- For a heartier meal, use them as a base for poached eggs or avocado toast.

​Welcome to cookie perfection! These aren't just any cookies, they're the ultimate gluten-free and egg-free cookies that are about to revolutionize your baking game. Prepare yourself for a treat that's so delicious, so irresistible, that you'll find it hard to believe they're free from gluten and eggs.

What makes these cookies truly special? It's the perfect balance of textures and flavors, achieved through a carefully crafted blend of gluten-free flours and starches, combined with the rich depth of browned butter and the perfect mix of sugars. The result? A cookie that's crisp around the edges, delightfully chewy in the center, and bursting with pockets of melted chocolate.

Whether you're gluten-intolerant, have an egg allergy, or are simply looking to explore new baking horizons, these cookies are a must-try. They're proof that dietary restrictions don't mean compromising on taste or texture. So, preheat your ovens and get ready to bake a batch of cookies that will have everyone begging for the recipe!

Ingredients for 8 large cookies:

Dry Ingredients:
- 125g brown rice flour
- 70g tapioca starch (or starch of choice)
- 15g corn starch
- 50g finely milled corn flour
- 1/2 tsp xanthan gum
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp baking powder

Wet Ingredients:
- 120g butter
- 120g dark brown sugar
- 50g light brown caster sugar
- 110g Greek yogurt (or yogurt of choice)
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract

Add-ins:
- 150-200g chocolate of choice (e.g., small and large dark chocolate chips)
Picture
The Science Behind the Ingredients

1. Brown Rice Flour: This gluten-free flour provides structure and a slightly nutty flavor. It's higher in protein compared to white rice flour, contributing to a better texture.
2. Tapioca Starch: Acts as a binder and helps create a chewy texture. It also aids in browning, giving the cookies a lovely golden color.
3. Corn Starch: Adds tenderness to the cookies and helps with moisture retention.
4. Corn Flour: Provides a subtle sweetness and helps create a crisp exterior.
5. Xanthan Gum: This is crucial in gluten-free baking as it mimics the elasticity and stickiness of gluten, helping to bind the ingredients together and prevent crumbling.
6. Baking Soda and Baking Powder: These leavening agents work together to provide the perfect rise. Baking soda reacts with the acidic ingredients (brown sugar and yogurt) for immediate leavening, while baking powder provides a secondary rise during baking.
7. Browned Butter: This is a key flavor enhancer. The process of browning butter creates nutty, caramel-like notes that add depth and richness to the cookies.
8. Sugars: The combination of dark brown and light brown sugars provides moisture, chewiness, and a complex sweetness. The molasses in brown sugar also reacts with the baking soda, aiding in leavening.
9. Greek Yogurt: This replaces eggs in the recipe. It adds moisture, helps with binding, and its acidity works with the baking soda for leavening. It also contributes to a tender crumb.
10. Vanilla Extract: Enhances all the other flavors in the cookie.
11. Chocolate: Provides bursts of flavor and textural contrast. Using a mix of sizes creates varied chocolate experiences in each bite.
Picture
Method

1. Brown the Butter:
   - Place the butter in a light-colored saucepan over medium heat.
   - Stir constantly as the butter melts, foams, and then begins to sputter.
   - Keep stirring until you see golden-brown specks forming at the bottom of the pan and the butter smells nutty.
   - Immediately remove from heat and transfer to a heat-safe bowl to cool.
   - Why brown the butter? This process creates complex flavor compounds that give the cookies a rich, nutty taste that can't be achieved with regular melted butter.

2. Prepare the Dry Ingredients:
   - In a medium bowl, whisk together the brown rice flour, tapioca starch, corn starch, corn flour, xanthan gum, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.
   - Mixing these ingredients separately ensures even distribution of the leavening agents and xanthan gum.

3. Mix the Wet Ingredients:
   - Once the browned butter has cooled to room temperature, add it to a large mixing bowl.
   - Add both types of sugar to the butter and mix until well combined.
   - Stir in the Greek yogurt and vanilla extract until the mixture is smooth.

4. Combine Wet and Dry:
   - Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
   - Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to tough cookies.

5. Add Chocolate:
   - Fold in your chosen chocolate chips or chunks.

6. Chill the Dough:
   - Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, or for at least 4 hours.
   - This resting period allows the flours to fully hydrate and the flavors to meld. It also firms up the dough, preventing excessive spreading during baking.

7. Prepare for Baking:
   - Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C).
   - Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

8. Shape the Cookies:
   - Remove the dough from the refrigerator.
   - Divide the dough into 8 equal portions, each weighing approximately 90-100g.
   - Roll each portion into a ball and place on the prepared baking sheet, leaving ample space between each cookie for spreading.

9. Bake:
   - Bake for 20-22 minutes, until the edges are visibly browned but the centers still look soft.
   - For crispier cookies, bake for an additional 3-5 minutes.

10. Cool:
    - Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool completely on the baking sheet.
    - The cookies will be very soft when first out of the oven but will firm up as they cool.


​Storage and Serving Suggestions
- Once completely cooled, store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.
- For longer storage, place cooled cookies in a freezer-safe container, separating layers with parchment paper. Freeze for up to 3 months.
- To reheat, warm in a 300°F (150°C) oven for 5-7 minutes.
- These cookies are divine on their own, but try serving them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra indulgent treat.
- Crumble cooled cookies over yogurt or use as a base for an ice cream sandwich.

 Tips and Tricks
- For perfectly round cookies, use a large round cookie cutter to gently shape the cookies immediately after removing from the oven.
- If you don't have time for overnight chilling, you can freeze the shaped dough balls for 30 minutes before baking.
- For a flavor variation, try adding chopped nuts, dried fruit, or different types of chocolate.
