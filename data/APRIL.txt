Gluten-Free Baklava with Homemade Phyllo Dough: A Labor of Love Worth Taking On!

Baklava, a classic Middle Eastern dessert, is known for its layers of flaky phyllo dough and a rich nut filling. But for those following a gluten-free diet, enjoying this treat can seem like a distant dream. Well, fret no more! This recipe unveils the secrets to making your own gluten-free phyllo dough, paving the way for a delicious and accessible baklava experience.

Part 1: The Art of Gluten-Free Phyllo Dough
Making phyllo dough requires patience and a bit of practice, but the reward is well worth the effort. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process:

Ingredients:
6 g psyllium husk
160 g lukewarm water
105 g brown rice flour or oat flour 
66 g tapioca starch or potato starch 
42 g corn flour, finely milled
20 g sugar
5 g xanthan gum
3 g salt
35 g unsalted butter, melted and cooled
Equipment:
Mixing bowl
Spoon
Rolling pin
Parchment paper
Plastic wrap
Ruler (optional)

Instructions:
Activating the Psyllium Husk: In a small bowl, combine the psyllium husk with half the lukewarm water (80 g). Set it aside for 5-7 minutes, allowing the psyllium to form a thick gel.
Dry Ingredients Mix: In a large bowl, whisk together the brown rice flour (or oat flour), tapioca starch (or potato starch), corn flour, sugar, xanthan gum, and salt.
Wet Ingredients Combine: Add the psyllium husk gel, remaining lukewarm water (80 g), and melted butter to the dry ingredients. Using a spoon, mix everything until a shaggy dough forms.
Kneading the Dough: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (use rice flour). Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes, adding minimal extra flour if needed, until it becomes smooth and elastic.
Divide and Rest: Divide the dough into 6-8 equal balls. Cover each ball tightly with plastic wrap to prevent drying out.
Preparing the Rolling Surface: Lay a large sheet of parchment paper on your work surface. Dust the parchment paper lightly with rice flour.

Rolling Out the Dough: This is the most time-consuming step but crucial for achieving thin, flaky layers. Here's a breakdown for successful rolling:
Initial Rolling: Take one dough ball and place it on the floured parchment paper. Dust the top of the dough ball with rice flour. Using a rolling pin, gently roll out the dough into a thin sheet.
Consistent Dusting: Keep the surface you're working on, the rolling pin, and the dough surface well dusted with rice flour to prevent sticking.
Reaching Thinness: Continue rolling until the dough is very thin. A good way to test the transparency is to place a piece of paper with writing on it under the dough. If you can read the writing clearly, it's thin enough.

Tip: Don't be discouraged if you can't achieve paper-thin sheets right away. Practice makes perfect!

Trimming and Folding: Once you have a very thin sheet of dough, use a knife or ruler (optional) to trim the uneven edges, creating a clean rectangles.
Folding for Storage: Gently fold the rolled sheet of dough in half lengthwise, and then fold it in half again to create a smaller rectangle. This makes it easier to manage and store.
Storing the Phyllo Dough: Wrap the folded dough sheet in plastic wrap to prevent drying. Repeat steps 6-9 for the remaining dough balls. Stack the wrapped dough sheets on top of each other, separated by plastic wrap sheets.
Chilling or Freezing: You can store the phyllo dough in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or freeze it for up to 3 months. Thaw frozen dough sheets in the refrigerator overnight before using.​

Part 2: Assembling the Baklava and Making the Syrup

Now that you've mastered the art of gluten-free phyllo dough, let's create the delectable filling and fragrant syrup for your baklava!

Ingredients for the Filling:
90 g shelled and finely chopped pistachios 
90 g chopped pecans 
30 g hazelnut flour (optional)
140 g melted unsalted butter
3 tbsp granulated sugar
1/2 tbsp ground cinnamon
1 tbsp orange blossom water
1 tsp salt

Instructions for the Filling:
Combine Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the chopped pistachios, pecans, hazelnut flour (if using), sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Mix well to distribute the flavorings evenly.
Incorporate Wet Ingredients: Add the melted butter and orange blossom water to the dry ingredients. Using a spoon or spatula, mix everything thoroughly until a moist and fragrant filling forms.

Ingredients for the Syrup:
150 g brown sugar (or sugar of your choice like coconut sugar)
75 g water
2 tbsp orange blossom water or vanilla extract
Pinch of salt
Instructions for the Syrup:
Combine Sugar and Water: In a saucepan, combine the brown sugar and water. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves completely.
Bring to a Simmer: Once the sugar dissolves, bring the syrup to a gentle simmer. Avoid boiling vigorously to prevent burning.
Flavor & Cool: Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5-7 minutes, allowing the syrup to thicken slightly. Stir in the orange blossom water (or vanilla extract) and a pinch of salt.
Cooling the Syrup: Remove the syrup from the heat and set it aside to cool completely at room temperature.

​Tip: The cooled syrup should be slightly thick and have a syrupy consistency.

Part 3: Assembling and Baking the Gluten-Free Baklava

Now that you have your homemade gluten-free phyllo dough and a delicious nut filling prepared, it's time to assemble and bake your baklava!

​Preheat the Oven: Start by preheating your oven to 300°F (150°C). This lower temperature ensures even baking and prevents the baklava from burning.

Preparing the Phyllo Dough Sheets: Take your previously made phyllo dough sheets and carefully cut each sheet into three or four rectangular pieces using a sharp knife. Aim for rectangles that will fit comfortably in your baking pan. You should end up with approximately 24-32 rectangular phyllo sheets.

Melting Butter and Brushing: Melt enough unsalted butter for brushing the phyllo layers. Keep it warm and readily available for easy layering.

Assembling the Baklava:
Grease the Pan: Lightly grease a rectangular baking pan (ideally 9" x 13").
Initial Butter Layer: Brush the bottom of the pan with melted butter.
First Phyllo Layer: Take 10 of your prepared phyllo dough rectangles and layer them one on top of the other in the pan. Brush each sheet generously with melted butter as you layer them.
Spreading the Filling: Spread half of your prepared nut filling evenly over the buttered phyllo layer.
Second Phyllo Layer: Repeat steps 3 and 4, layering 10-12 phyllo sheets with melted butter in between, on top of the filling.
Remaining Filling & Top Layer: Spread the remaining half of the nut filling and then top it with the remaining phyllo dough sheets, brushing each one with butter.
Diamond Cuts: This is where the iconic diamond shape of baklava comes in! Use a sharp knife to carefully cut diagonal lines across the top layer of phyllo dough, creating diamond shapes. You can cut all the way down to the bottom layer, but stop just before to avoid scratching the baking pan.

Tip: If you have leftover phyllo dough pieces, don't waste them! Crumble them up and sprinkle them between the layers. This adds extra texture and crunch.

Baking the Baklava:
Golden Perfection: Place the assembled baklava in your preheated oven (300°F/150°C) and bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 minutes. Keep an eye on it during baking, and adjust the time slightly if needed. The baklava is done when the top surface is golden brown and crispy.

Soaking with Syrup:
Cooling the Baklava: Once golden brown, remove the baklava from the oven and slowly drizzle the syrup evenly over the top of the baklava, allowing it to soak into the layers. You don't have to use all the syrup, adjust based on your desired sweetness level.
​
Healthy Syrup Option: Here's an alternative for a healthier syrup:
Combine 150 g honey or date syrup with 75 g water in a saucepan. Heat gently until the honey or date syrup melts and the mixture thickens slightly. Remove from heat and cool completely before using. 


Storing Your Baklava:
Your gluten-free baklava can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days, covered with plastic wrap or an airtight container. To extend its shelf life, you can store it in the refrigerator for up to a two weeks, tightly wrapped or freeze it.

​Revive the Crispness of Your Gluten-Free Baklava: Fridge and Freezer

While gluten-free baklava is incredibly delicious, storing it can sometimes affect its crispiness. But fear not! Here are some tips to revive the delightful flakiness of your baklava, whether it's been stored in the fridge or freezer:

Reviving Fridge-Stored Baklava:
The Oven Method: This is the quickest and most effective way to restore crispness. Preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C). Slice off a piece of your baklava and place it on a baking sheet. Bake for 5-7 minutes, or until the top layer becomes golden brown and crispy again. Keep an eye on it to avoid burning.
Reviving Freezer-Stored Baklava:
For baklava stored in the freezer, you'll need to thaw it completely before reviving the crispness. Here's how:
Overnight Thaw: The gentlest method is to transfer the frozen baklava to the refrigerator overnight. This allows it to thaw slowly and evenly.
Room Temperature Thaw: If you're short on time, you can thaw the baklava at room temperature. However, this might take several hours depending on the thickness.
Once thawed, use the oven method mentioned above to restore the crispiness.

By following these tips, you can easily bring back the delightful texture of your homemade gluten-free baklava, no matter how you've stored it. Now go forth and savor every crispy, nutty bite!

Enjoy! Now comes the best part - savor your delicious creation! Share it with friends and family, and celebrate the joy of baking a gluten-free masterpiece.

Gluten-Free Pure Butter Shortbread Cookies that Melt in Your Mouth!

Scrumptious Gluten-Free Shortbread Cookies: A Deliciously Modern Twist on a Classic Treat

For generations, shortbread cookies have held a special place in our hearts. Their simple elegance and melt-in-your-mouth texture have made them a teatime favorite and a delightful accompaniment for a cup of coffee or tea. But what if you can't indulge in traditional wheat-based treats due to gluten sensitivities? Worry not, fellow cookie enthusiasts! This recipe unveils a fantastic gluten-free rendition that captures the essence of classic shortbread while catering to dietary restrictions.

A Brief History of Shortbread:
Shortbread, originating from Scotland, boasts a rich history dating back to the 11th century. Initially a luxury reserved for royalty and the wealthy, its popularity gradually spread throughout the British Isles and beyond. Traditionally made with just butter, sugar, and flour, shortbread's simplicity lies at the heart of its enduring appeal.

The Magic of Gluten-Free Shortbread:
This recipe achieves the magic of gluten-free shortbread by utilizing a unique blend of flours. Brown rice flour or oat flour provide a base and crumbly texture, while tapioca starch or potato starch contribute to a light and airy feel. Cornstarch adds a touch of structure and prevents crumbling. Xanthan gum, a gluten substitute, binds the ingredients together, ensuring the cookies hold their shape during baking.

Ingredients:
155 g softened butter (not melted)
80 g sugar (brown or white, based on your preference)
125 g brown rice flour or oat flour
75 g tapioca starch or potato starch
60 g cornstarch (maizena)
50 g corn flour
2 tsp vanilla extract (or vanilla paste or powder)
3/4 tsp xanthan gum
3/4 tsp salt

Method:
Creaming the Butter & Sugar: Preheat your oven to 320°F (160°C). In a bowl, gently combine the softened butter, sugar, and vanilla extract with a spoon. Avoid vigorous whisking or whipping, as you want to minimize air incorporation to prevent unwanted spreading during baking.
Bringing it Together: Add all the flours, salt, and xanthan gum to the creamed mixture. Using your hands, knead the ingredients together until a cohesive, non-sticky dough ball forms.
Shaping & Pricking: Place the dough ball on a piece of parchment paper. Top it with another sheet of parchment paper and roll it out into a rectangle roughly 28 cm x 24 cm (adjust based on your desired cookie thickness). Use a ruler and knife to mark the dough into rectangles approximately 7-8 cm long and 3-4 cm wide (yielding roughly 18-20 cookies). Using a fork, gently prick each marked rectangle a few times to create the characteristic shortbread holes.
Baking & Cooling: Gently transfer the marked cookie rectangles to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. For a touch of added sweetness, sprinkle some sugar on top (optional). Bake for 20-25 minutes at 320°F (160°C) on the middle rack, keeping an eye on them after the 20-minute mark. Look for slightly browned edges to indicate doneness.
Enjoyment & Storage: Let the cookies cool completely on the baking sheet. They may appear slightly fragile when warm, but they harden as they cool. Savor these gluten-free delights with a cup of tea or coffee, or enjoy them on their own.​




Tips for Success:
Ensure your butter is softened to room temperature for optimal creaming.
Use a light touch while mixing the dough to avoid incorporating air.
Don't overbake the cookies; aim for slightly browned edges for the best texture.
Allow the cookies to cool entirely before storing them in an airtight container at room temperature. They will keep fresh for up to a week.

These gluten-free shortbread cookies are a testament to the fact that delicious treats can be enjoyed by everyone. Their melt-in-your-mouth texture and rich buttery flavor rival any traditional shortbread. So next time you're craving a delightful cookie experience, whip up a batch of these gluten-free gems and share the joy!

Storage Tips:
Store leftover cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.
For extended storage, you can freeze the baked cookies in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Thaw them at room temperature before enjoying.

Additional Tips:
Feel free to experiment with different flavorings! Add a teaspoon of orange zest or a pinch of ground cinnamon for a delightful twist.
This dough can also be used to create shortbread bars. Simply press the dough evenly into a greased baking pan and bake for the same amount of time, or until lightly golden brown. Cut into bars once cool.

I hope you find this recipe informative and enjoyable! Don't hesitate to leave a comment below and share your experience baking these gluten-free shortbread cookies. ​

A Classic with a Twist: Chicken fried rice is a beloved staple in many cultures, offering a versatile platform for endless flavor combinations. This recipe takes a classic approach with its base of fluffy white rice, savory cooked chicken, and a medley of colorful vegetables. But for a unique umami twist, we swap out traditional soy sauce for coconut aminos.

They are typically lower in sodium and contain no added sugars, making them a great choice for those looking for a healthier option. And trust us, the flavor in this dish doesn't disappoint!

Ready to experience the perfect balance of comfort and health? Dive into this Coconut Aminos Chicken Fried Rice recipe and enjoy a delicious and satisfying weeknight meal the whole family will love!

Here's what you'll need (serves 3-4):
300 grams (½ pound) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into small cubes
4 tablespoons coconut aminos
2 tablespoons tomato paste OR ketchup (a healthy one recommended if not stick with tomato paste)
1 teaspoon sesame oil (optional)
4 tablespoons grated ginger
2 tablespoons grated garlic (optional, omit for LOW-FODMAP)
2 bunches scallions, green parts sliced
2 carrots, diced into small cubes
2 zucchinis, diced into small cubes
1 cup frozen green peas
2 eggs
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 cups cooked white rice (see note below for perfect fluffy rice)
2 tablespoons olive oil

Cooking Perfect Fluffy Rice:
For the best texture in your fried rice, use completely cooled, cooked white rice. Here's how to achieve that perfect fluffiness:
Rinse the rice thoroughly in cold water until the water runs clear.
Combine 2 cup rinsed rice with 2 cups water in a saucepan.
Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes without lifting the lid.
Remove from heat and let steam undisturbed for 5 minutes before fluffing with a fork.
Allow the rice to cool completely before using in the fried rice recipe. Tip: Cook the rice the day before for added convenience. Or, you can you any leftover rice you have that is not heavily spiced. 

Let's Get Cooking!
Marinate the Chicken: In a bowl, combine the chicken cubes with 2 tablespoons coconut aminos, 1 tablespoon tomato paste/ketchup, 1 tablespoon grated ginger, and 1 tablespoon grated garlic (if using). Marinate in the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes.
Prep the Veggies: While the chicken marinates, wash and dice your carrots, zucchini, and slice the  scallions.
Cook the Chicken: Heat olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Dredge the marinated chicken in cornstarch, coating it evenly. Add the chicken to the pan and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 5-10 minutes. Remove the cooked chicken from the pan and set aside.
Sauté the Veggies: In the same skillet, add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, scallions (white and light green parts), carrots, zucchini, ginger (if not using in marinade), and garlic (if using). Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 20-25 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened.
Scramble the Eggs: Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and crack in the eggs. Scramble the eggs until almost cooked through, then combine with the vegetables.
Combine Everything & Heat Through: Add the cooked chicken and cooked rice to the pan with the vegetables and eggs. Pour in the remaining 2 tablespoons coconut aminos and stir-fry for another 5-10 minutes, or until the rice is heated through and has absorbed the sauce.
Serve & Enjoy! Remove the pan from heat and garnish with the remaining sliced green scallion tops. Serve your healthy and flavorful Chicken Fried Rice hot and enjoy!​

Storage Instructions:
Leftover Chicken Fried Rice can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in a pan over medium heat, adding a splash of water or broth if needed to prevent drying out.

​A Few Final Tips:
Feel free to adjust the amount of vegetables based on your preferences. Other colorful additions like chopped bell peppers, chopped kale, cooked corn, or broccoli florets would work well.
For a spicier version, add a pinch of red pepper flakes along with the ginger and garlic.

​A Taste of Italy: Gluten-Free Gnocchi alla Sorrentina

Embark on a Gluten-Free Escape to Campania with Gnocchi alla Sorrentina! Close your eyes and imagine yourself transported to the sun-drenched Amalfi Coast, a breathtaking stretch of coastline in Campania, Italy. The scent of citrus fills the air, turquoise waters lap at the rugged shores, and the aroma of a delicious meal wafts from a charming trattoria. That meal? It could very well be our star dish today: Gnocchi alla Sorrentina!

These melt-in-your-mouth potato dumplings, known as gnocchi (pronounced nyok-kee), are a beloved staple of Italian cuisine. Traditionally crafted with wheat flour, this recipe offers a delightful twist using alternative flours, making it a perfect choice for those following a gluten-free diet.

A Bite of History:
Gnocchi's origins likely trace back to the resourceful kitchens of Southern Italy during the Middle Ages. Back then, people weren't strangers to using what they had on hand. Early versions of gnocchi may have been made with breadcrumbs instead of flour, a testament to the ingenuity of Italian cooks. Over time, these humble beginnings evolved into the soft, pillowy potato dumplings we cherish today.

The Sorrento Connection:
"Alla Sorrentina" translates to "Sorrento style," a nod to the picturesque coastal town near Naples where this dish reigns supreme. Sorrento's vibrant culture and stunning scenery have captivated visitors for centuries, and its culinary scene reflects this rich heritage. This gnocchi recipe embodies Sorrento's simplicity and love for fresh, flavorful ingredients. It features a simple yet delightful tomato sauce, creamy mozzarella cheese, and of course, the pillowy gnocchi – a perfect harmony of textures and tastes.
So, are you ready to embark on a delicious gluten-free adventure to Italy? Let's get cooking and savor the magic of Gnocchi alla Sorrentina!

Ingredients:
For the Gluten-Free Gnocchi (makes about 4 servings):
500g russet potatoes or starchy potatoes (peeled and boiled)
½ cup brown rice flour (or oat flour)
¼ cup tapioca starch
1 large egg
Salt to taste
For the Easy Tomato Sauce:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
½ teaspoon dried oregano
Salt and black pepper to taste
For the Assembly:
1 cup grated mozzarella cheese (lactose-free or regular)
Fresh basil leaves (optional, for garnish)

Instructions:

Making the Gluten-Free Gnocchi:
Boil the Potatoes: Place the peeled potatoes in a large pot of salted water and bring to a boil. Cover and cook for 30-35 minutes, or until fork-tender. Drain the potatoes well and return them to the pot over low heat for a few minutes to evaporate any excess moisture.
Mashing and Mixing: Once cool enough to handle, mash the potatoes thoroughly. You can use a potato ricer or a hand mixer for a smoother texture.
Adding the Flours: In a large bowl, combine the mashed potatoes with the brown rice flour (or oat flour), tapioca starch, and the egg. Season with salt to taste. Tip: Start with half of the flour and gradually add more until the dough becomes workable but not sticky. 
Shaping the Gnocchi: Lightly flour a clean work surface. Divide the dough into four equal portions. Roll each portion into a long rope, about 1 inch thick. Using a sharp knife, cut the ropes into ¾ inch pieces.
Creating the Gnocchi Shape: (Optional) For a more traditional look, use a fork to gently press each gnocchi piece against the tines of the fork, creating ridges.​


Cooking the Gnocchi:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully drop the gnocchi, a few pieces at a time, into the boiling water. The gnocchi are cooked when they float to the surface. This will take about 1-2 minutes.
Scooping and Reserving: Using a slotted spoon, remove the cooked gnocchi and transfer them to a waiting bowl or plate. Drizzle with a little olive oil to prevent sticking. Repeat until all the gnocchi are cooked.
Making the Easy Tomato Sauce:
Sautéing the Aromatics: In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute, until fragrant.
Adding the Canned Tomatoes: Pour in the crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Tip: If the sauce is too thick, you can add a splash of water or broth to thin it out.
Assembly and Enjoying your dish!
Combining the Gnocchi and Sauce: Add the cooked gnocchi to the simmering tomato sauce. Gently toss to coat the gnocchi evenly with the sauce.
Adding Cheese: Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the grated mozzarella cheese. Let the cheese melt, creating a creamy sauce.
Serving and Finishing Touches: Serve the gnocchi alla Sorrentina hot, spooned onto plates. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired.​


Tips for Success:
Use the Right Potatoes: Russet or starchy potatoes are ideal for gnocchi as they have a high moisture content and create a soft dough.
Don't Overwork the Dough: Overworking the dough can make the gnocchi tough. Once the ingredients are just combined and the dough is no longer sticky, stop kneading.
Control the Cooking Time: Don't overcook the gnocchi! They only need a few minutes to cook through once they float to the surface of the boiling water.
Less is More with Flour: Adding too much flour can make the gnocchi dense. Start with less flour and add more only if necessary to achieve a workable dough.
Embrace Imperfection: Homemade gnocchi don't have to be perfectly uniform. Slight variations in size and shape add to their rustic charm.

Conclusion:
This gluten-free gnocchi alla Sorrentina recipe is a delightful way to experience a taste of Italy. The combination of soft potato dumplings bathed in a simple tomato sauce and creamy mozzarella cheese is a true comfort food classic. With a few simple tips and techniques, you can create this delicious dish at home and impress your family and friends. So, put on some Italian music, grab your ingredients, and embark on this culinary adventure!

​Buon appetito!

Ingredients:
180 g rolled gluten-free oats
120 g oat flour
150 g coconut sugar (or brown sugar or sugar of choice)
Pinch of salt
100 grams nuts of your choice (pecans used in this example, roughly chopped)
2 tbsp sesame seeds (black, white, or both)
2 tbsp pumpkin seeds
2 tbsp sunflower seeds
2 tbsp desiccated coconut
1 tbsp chocolate chips (optional, for sprinkling on top before baking)
100 g butter or coconut oil
100 g date syrup (or maple syrup or honey)
1 large egg
1 tsp vanilla extract

Method:
Preheat the Oven: Set your oven to 165°C (325°F) and line a 9x9 inch baking pan with unbleached parchment paper for easy removal.
Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the rolled gluten-free oats, oat flour, coconut sugar (or your chosen sweetener), and a pinch of salt.
Nuts & Seeds: Chop your chosen nuts (pecans in this case) and add them to the dry ingredients along with the sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and desiccated coconut.
Building the Granola Mixture:
Melt the Butter or Coconut Oil: In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter or coconut oil.
Sweetener & Egg: Once melted, remove the pan from heat and stir in the chosen sweetener (honey, maple syrup, or date syrup) along with the egg and vanilla extract. Whisk until well combined and a smooth, creamy mixture forms.
Combining & Baking:
Wet Meets Dry: Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix well using a spatula. You want to achieve a sticky granola-like consistency that holds together when pressed.

Cooling & Cutting (30-40 minutes):
Cool Completely: Remove the baking pan from the oven and let the granola bars cool completely in the pan for at least 10 minutes. This allows them to firm up further. For easier cutting into clean bars, place the entire baking pan (with parchment paper still lining it) in the freezer for 20-30 minutes. The chilled granola will be easier to cut without crumbling.
Cut & Enjoy!: After chilling, remove the granola bars from the pan using the parchment paper overhang. Use a sharp knife to cut them into evenly sized bars.​

Tips:
Don't have oat flour? Simply grind rolled oats in a blender or food processor until a flour-like consistency is achieved.

Want a chewier bar? Add a ¼ cup of mashed banana or applesauce to the wet ingredients.

Method:
​
Effortless One-Pot Magic (30-40 minutes):
Prep is Key: Remove any excess fat from the chicken breast and cut it into a large, even-sized piece. This ensures even cooking throughout.
Chop the Leeks: Finely chop the leeks, separating the white and light green parts.
One-Pot Wonder: In your large pot or Dutch oven, combine all the ingredients: chopped leeks (white and light green parts), tomato sauce, tomato concentrate, or ketchup (choose low-FODMAP options if needed), apple cider vinegar, coconut aminos, your preferred sweetener (brown sugar, honey, maple syrup), Dijon mustard, bay leaves, oregano, garlic (if using), cinnamon, paprika, salt, and 1 cup of water.
Simmer & Shred (30-40 minutes): Bring the mixture in the pot to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and very tender.
Effortless Shredding (2 minutes): Once cooked, remove the bay leaves. Using a hand mixer, carefully shred the chicken directly in the pot. This method ensures quick and effortless shredding into perfectly thin strips.
Thicken the Sauce (5-10 minutes): While shredding the chicken, increase the heat to medium-high and simmer the sauce uncovered for an additional 5 minutes. This allows the sauce to thicken slightly while some of the liquid evaporates, creating a richer consistency. Thicken to your desired consistency. If the sauce is already thickened skip this step, and if its too thick add 1/2 cup of water to loosen it up. 
Reunite & Enjoy!: Add the shredded chicken back to the sauce and stir to coat evenly. Taste and adjust seasonings with additional salt.




This one-pot low-FODMAP pulled chicken is a flavor bomb waiting to be devoured! Here are some delicious serving suggestions to make this a complete and satisfying meal:
Loaded Nachos: Pile this BBQ magic onto baked tortilla chips, top with your favorite low-FODMAP toppings like shredded cheese, sliced avocado, and chopped fresh cilantro.
BBQ Chicken Bowl: Serve the pulled chicken over a bed of fluffy rice or quinoa, add roasted vegetables like bell peppers and onions, and drizzle with extra sauce.
Pulled Chicken Burgers: Ditch the beef and build a delicious BBQ chicken burger! Toast gluten-free hamburger buns, top with the pulled chicken, coleslaw, and a dollop of your BBQ sauce.
Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
Tips:
Feel free to adjust the spices to your preference. Smoked paprika adds a deeper smoky flavor, while a pinch of cayenne pepper brings a touch of heat.
If you don't have coconut aminos, you can use low-FODMAP soy sauce.
Don't have a hand mixer? Shred the chicken with two forks after removing it from the pot. While not as quick, it still gets the job done!

This recipe is a perfect example of how healthy eating and delicious flavors can come together in a single pot. Enjoy the smoky satisfaction of BBQ chicken without the guilt of store-bought sauces or high FODMAP ingredients.

​Enjoy!

Ultimate Gluten-Free Oat Flour Cookies: Crispy Outside, Gooey Inside!

​The Ultimate Gluten-Free Oat Flour Cookies: Crispy on the Outside, Gooey on the Inside

Craving a decadent treat that satisfies your sweet tooth without compromising on texture or dietary needs? Look no further than these heavenly Gluten-Free Oat Flour Cookies! These delightful bites boast a perfectly crisp exterior that gives way to a lusciously gooey center, creating an irresistible textural contrast in every bite. And the best part? They're entirely gluten-free, making them a dream come true for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivities.

But the magic doesn't stop there! This recipe utilizes a unique blend of ingredients to achieve its remarkable texture and flavor. We'll delve into the science behind each ingredient, ensuring you not only bake delicious cookies but also understand the "why" behind the "what."

The Power of the Perfect Blend:
Oat Flour (or Rice Flour): The foundation of these cookies, oat flour (or rice flour for a nut-free option) provides a naturally gluten-free base with a subtle oat flavor and a satisfying chew.
Nut Flour (Optional): We incorporate a touch of nut flour, like almond or hazelnut flour (as used here) for a delightful nutty depth of flavor. This enhances the overall taste profile and adds a touch of sophistication.
The Sugar Symphony: This recipe uses a combination of brown sugar and cane sugar for a symphony of sweetness. Brown sugar contributes a rich molasses flavor and helps with achieving that signature chewy texture, while cane sugar provides a clean sweetness and promotes crisping.
Egg Yolks: Egg yolks act as binding agents, holding the cookie dough together. They also contribute to the gooey center by adding moisture and richness.
Baking Soda vs. Baking Powder: Unlike baking powder which is a leavening agent containing both baking soda and an acidic component, baking soda requires an acidic ingredient (like brown sugar in this case) to activate and create lift in the cookies. This ensures the perfect balance between crispness and chew.
Softened Butter: Softened butter is key! Creaming softened butter with the sugars incorporates air into the dough, leading to a lighter and fluffier cookie. This creaming process also helps create a more flavorful and evenly textured treat.

Now, let's get baking and create these delightful gluten-free masterpieces!

Ingredients (for approximately 12 small cookies):
140 grams Oat Flour (or Rice Flour)
20 grams Nut Flour of your choice (optional, if not using add more oat flour)
2 Egg Yolks
1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract
½ teaspoon Baking Soda
6 tablespoons Softened Butter
4 tablespoons Brown Sugar
4 tablespoons Cane Sugar
Handful of Chocolate Chips (dark, milk, or a combination)
Optional Toppings (after baking): Chocolate Chips, Hazelnut Butter (for a praline taste)

Method:
Preheat Party: Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This ensures even baking and prevents sticking.
The Flour Power: In a medium bowl, whisk together the oat flour (or rice flour) and your chosen nut flour (if using). Set this dry mixture aside for now.
Creamy Perfection: In a separate bowl, using an electric mixer or a good old-fashioned whisk, cream together the softened butter and both sugars (brown and cane) until light and fluffy. This creaming process is crucial for achieving the perfect texture!
Yolks on a Mission: Once the sugar and butter mixture is beautifully creamed, beat in the egg yolks one at a time, ensuring each yolk is fully incorporated before adding the next.
Flavor Symphony: Stir in the vanilla extract and baking soda, mixing until just combined.
The Grand Union: Now, gradually add the dry ingredients (oat flour mixture) to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Don't overmix! Overmixing can lead to tough cookies.
Chocolatey Dreams: Gently fold in your chosen chocolate chips (and any additional nuts you may want to include).
Baking Time! Using a spoon or cookie scoop, portion the dough onto your prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each cookie for spreading.
Bake to Gooey Perfection: Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are still  slightly soft. The gooey magic lies in slightly underbaking them! 
Optional Topping Time: Before the cookies harden and set you can add additional chocolate chips and some hazelnut butter (for that extra praline touch) by slightly pushing them on top of each cookie for a bakery-style look. 
Cooling: Let the Cookies set and cool completely before enjoyin them!



​Sweet Success: Tips and Tricks
Measure Matters: For best results, use measuring cups and spoons to ensure accurate proportions of ingredients.
Softened Butter is Key: Don't use melted butter! Softened butter incorporates air during creaming, leading to a lighter and fluffier cookie.
Don't Overmix: Resist the urge to overmix the dough. Once the ingredients are just combined, stop mixing to prevent tough cookies.
Let Them Rest: Allow the cookies to cool completely on the baking sheet before transferring them. This allows them to set properly.
Storage Solutions: Store leftover cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
Freezing Option: For longer storage, you can freeze the baked cookies in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Thaw them at room temperature before enjoying.​

The Final Bite:
These Gluten-Free Oat Flour Cookies are a testament to the fact that deliciousness doesn't have to come at the expense of dietary needs. With their delightful combination of crispy edges, gooey centers, and a symphony of flavors, they're sure to become a new favorite. So, gather your ingredients, preheat your oven, and get ready to embark on a baking adventure that will leave your taste buds singing!

​Dive into Delectable Delights: Mastering Mini Moroccan Sfenj (Gluten-Free!)

Craving a breakfast sensation that transcends the ordinary? Look no further than Sfenj, a cornerstone of Moroccan cuisine. These golden-brown delights, traditionally enjoyed warm and fresh, boast a delightfully crispy exterior and a light, fluffy interior.

A Bite-Sized Journey Through History:
Sfenj's roots in Morocco weave a tale lost to time. While some culinary historians posit origins in Al-Andalus (Muslim Spain) during the 12th century, the exact birthplace of this delightful treat remains a delicious mystery. What's undeniable is Sfenj's deep connection to Moroccan tradition. They've graced festive occasions and adorned breakfast tables for generations, a testament to their enduring popularity. Perhaps it's the simplicity of their preparation, the delightful play of textures between the crisp exterior and fluffy interior, or the festive air they evoke. Whatever the reason, Sfenj have become a cornerstone of Moroccan cuisine, enjoyed by locals and visitors alike. Today, they continue to be a cherished symbol of Moroccan culinary heritage, a golden reminder of the country's rich history and vibrant flavors.

The Magic of Gluten-Free Freedom:
This recipe specifically caters to those seeking a gluten-free breakfast option. The unique blend of rice flour, oat flour (if using), and starches creates a light and airy texture without the use of wheat flour. This makes Sfenj a perfect choice for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. The foundation of this recipe lies in the combination of rice flour and oat flour (optional). Rice flour provides a neutral flavor and a light, airy texture, while oat flour (if used) adds a subtle oat flavor and extra heartiness. The chosen starch, whether potato, tapioca, or cornstarch, plays a crucial role in achieving the signature crispiness.
​
Picture
Now, let's gather the ingredients to embark on this delightful culinary adventure!

Ingredients (for approximately 10 Mini Sfenj):
60 grams Rice Flour or Oat Flour 
50 grams Starch (choose Potato, Tapioca, or Cornstarch)
15 grams Finely Milled Corn Flour
½ teaspoon Xanthan Gum 
1 tablespoon Psyllium Husk Powder 
Pinch of Salt
1 tablespoon Sugar
¾ - 1 cup Warm Milk (amount may vary depending on flour and starch type)
1 teaspoon Active Dry Yeast
Frying Oil (choose an oil with a high smoke point, like avocado oil)

Creating Your Dreamy Mini Sfenj: A Step-by-Step Guide
Uniting the Dry Ingredients:
In a large bowl, whisk together the rice flour, chosen starch, finely milled corn flour, xanthan gum, psyllium husk powder, salt, and sugar. This ensures all the dry ingredients are evenly distributed.
Integrating the Warm Milk:
Next, slowly pour in the warm milk while whisking continuously. Aim for a very loose batter that is pourable but not runny. Consistency is key! The exact amount of milk needed may vary depending on the type of flour and starch used, so adjust slowly until you achieve the desired flow.
The Power of Rise:
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and let the batter rest in a warm place for 30-40 minutes. You'll witness the magic as the batter roughly doubles in size due to the yeast activation.
Heating Up for Sizzling Success:
In a wide, deep pot, cast iron or a Dutch oven, heat at least 2 inches of your chosen frying oil over medium heat. The oil needs to be hot but not scorching (around 350°F or 175°C).
Shaping the Mini Delights:
(Here's a detailed explanation for shaping the Sfenj):
Prepare a small bowl of water next to your cooking station. This will help prevent the batter from sticking to your hands. Dip your hands briefly in the water before grabbing a small piece of dough – about the size of a golf ball (or adjust for your preferred size).
Here comes the fun part! Using your thumb and forefinger, gently stretch a hole in the center of the dough ball, widening it to create a doughnut-like shape. The hole should be fairly large, as the Sfenj will puff up during frying.
Sizzling Symphony:
Carefully place the shaped Sfenj into the hot oil. You can gently lower it in using a spoon if needed. Don't overcrowd the pan – fry the Sfenj in batches to ensure even cooking.
The Art of the Golden Flip:
Keep a watchful eye on your frying Sfenj. After a minute or two, when the underside becomes golden brown, use a slotted spoon or fork to gently flip it over.
Golden Perfection Awaits:
Continue frying for another minute or two on the other side, until the Sfenj is golden brown all over. The key is to achieve a beautiful color without burning.
Draining the Excess Oil:
Once cooked through, use your slotted spoon or fork to transfer the Sfenj to a plate lined with paper towels. This allows the excess oil to drain, leaving you with a crispy and delightful treat.
Sweet or Savory Bliss (Optional):
While traditionally enjoyed dusted with powdered sugar for a touch of sweetness, Sfenj are versatile enough to adapt to your taste preferences. You can drizzle them with honey, maple syrup, or even your favourite jam.


Tips for Sfenj Success:
Temperature is Crucial: Ensure your oil is hot enough (around 350°F or 175°C) before frying. If the oil is not hot enough, the Sfenj will absorb too much oil and become greasy. Conversely, oil that is too hot can burn the Sfenj quickly.
The Power of Patience: Don't overcrowd the pan! Fry the Sfenj in batches to maintain the oil temperature and ensure even cooking.
Play with Size: While this recipe yields mini Sfenj, feel free to adjust the size according to your preference. Just remember to adjust the cooking time slightly for larger Sfenj.
The Water Bowl: The water bowl is your friend! Dipping your hands in water before shaping the Sfenj prevents the batter from sticking and ensures a smooth shaping process.

The Sweet Ending: Enjoying and Storing Your Mini Sfenj Delights
​Savor the Warmth: Sfenj are best enjoyed warm and fresh when they are at their crispiest.
Storage Solutions: If you have leftover Sfenj, store them in an airtight container in the freezer. However. 
Reheating Magic: To revive the crispness of leftover Sfenj, preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C) and place them on a baking sheet for a few minutes until warmed through and crispy again.

Embrace the Magic of Sfenj: A Delicious and Accessible TreatWith this recipe in hand, you can now embark on your very own Sfenj adventure. So, gather your ingredients, unleash your inner chef, and experience the delightful combination of crispy exterior and fluffy interior that defines this iconic Moroccan breakfast staple.

Enjoy!

Unveiling the Secrets of Baghrir: Mastering the Art of the Thousand-Hole Moroccan Pancake

Imagine a pancake so light and airy, it practically floats on your plate. Now, picture its surface dotted with countless tiny holes, each one a testament to its fluffy perfection. This, my friends, is the magic of Baghrir, the iconic Moroccan pancake that has captured hearts (and stomachs) for generations.
But achieving these ethereal delights isn't always a walk in the park. Fear not, aspiring Baghrir bakers! This comprehensive guide unravels the secrets behind this unique recipe, equipping you with the knowledge and techniques to create these fluffy wonders right at home.
Here's what sets this recipe apart:
Gluten-Free Freedom: We've crafted a recipe that caters to everyone, ensuring those with gluten sensitivities can still enjoy the deliciousness of Baghrir.
Foolproof Techniques: We break down each step with clear instructions and helpful tips, so you can achieve success on your first try (or close to it!).
Troubleshooting Tips: We anticipate potential challenges and offer solutions to ensure your Baghrir journey is smooth sailing.

How is Baghrir Traditionally Enjoyed
In Morocco, Baghrir reigns supreme as a breakfast staple. Traditionally, they are served piping hot off the pan and enjoyed in their pure, fluffy form. The most time-honored way to savor these delights is with a drizzle of warm honey and a pat of melted butter. This simple combination allows the delicate flavor and airy texture of the Baghrir to shine. Some variations incorporate a dollop of amlou, a sweet Moroccan spread made from roasted almonds, argan oil, and honey, adding a rich and nutty dimension to the experience. Whether you keep it classic with honey and butter or indulge in the decadent sweetness of amlou, Baghrir offers a delicious taste of Moroccan tradition.

Beyond the Basics: Mastering the Art of Baghrir
While the ingredient list for Baghrir may seem simple, the magic lies in the execution. Here's a treasure trove of tips and tricks to elevate your Baghrir game:
The Power of Flour Choice: Rice flour is the foundation of this recipe. However, feel free to experiment with alternative gluten-free flours like oat flour or sorghum flour. Just be mindful that different flours may absorb liquids differently, so slight adjustments to the water content might be necessary.
Starch Selection: The chosen starch plays a crucial role in achieving the signature holes. Potato starch and tapioca starch typically yield the best results, but cornstarch can also work in a pinch.
The Science of Baking Powder and Vinegar: The combination of baking powder and vinegar acts as a leavening agent, creating those coveted air pockets. Don't overmix the batter after adding these ingredients, as it can deflate the air bubbles and reduce the number of holes.
The Importance of Resting: Allowing the batter to rest for 15-20 minutes is crucial. This resting period lets the yeast activate and the batter thicken slightly, resulting in a light and airy texture.
The Art of Pan Control: Use a non-stick pan or a well-seasoned cast iron skillet. Ensure the pan is hot enough before adding the batter, but not scorching hot. Medium heat works best for achieving a perfect cook through without burning.
The Wet Pan Trick: Here's a secret weapon – wetting the pan before adding each Baghrir! This creates a slight steam effect, further contributing to the fluffy texture and those oh-so-desired holes.
The Single-Sided Wonder: Unlike traditional pancakes, Baghrir are only cooked on one side. Resist the urge to flip! The key to those thousand holes lies in this one-sided cooking.

The Blending Advantage: Unlocking the Secrets of Smoothness
While you can technically whisk the Baghrir batter by hand, incorporating a stand mixer or a hand blender is a game-changer for achieving the perfect texture. Here's why:
Superior Smoothness: Blending breaks down any lumps in the dry ingredients, resulting in an incredibly smooth batter. This smooth batter is essential for creating those delicate, even holes that are characteristic of Baghrir.
Enhanced Air Incorporation: The blending process introduces tiny air bubbles into the batter. These air bubbles expand during cooking, contributing to the signature light and airy texture of Baghrir.
Reduced Mixing Time: Using a blender allows you to achieve a well-combined batter in a fraction of the time compared to hand whisking. This is important because overmixing after adding the baking powder and vinegar can negatively impact the air bubbles and reduce the number of holes.

With these valuable insights by your side, you're well on your way to becoming a Baghrir connoisseur! Now, let's delve into the detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions to bring these fluffy delights to life...(Don't worry, trypophobes, the holes are delicious!)​
Picture
Here's what awaits you on this culinary journey:
Effortless One-Bowl Preparation: Forget sifting and endless bowls – this recipe embraces simplicity with all dry ingredients coming together in one place.
Gluten-Free Freedom: This recipe caters to gluten-free friends and family, ensuring everyone can enjoy the deliciousness of Baghrir.
Customizable Flavors: While traditionally enjoyed plain, a hint of orange blossom water or vanilla extract adds a touch of floral elegance (completely optional!).

Ingredients (for roughly 12-14 small to medium Baghrir):
1 cup Rice Flour (Gluten-Free)
1 cup Starch (choose Potato, Tapioca, or Cornstarch)
8 grams Baking Powder (1 sachet)
6 grams Active Dry Yeast
1 tablespoon Sugar (your choice - granulated, cane sugar, etc.)
2 teaspoons Vinegar (apple cider vinegar works well, but any type will do)
Pinch of Salt
1 teaspoon Orange Blossom Water or Vanilla Extract (optional)
1 1/4 cup Warm Water (amount may vary slightly depending on flour and starch type)
​
Creating Your Dreamy Baghrir: A Step-by-Step Guide
Uniting the Dry Ingredients:
In a large bowl, whisk together the rice flour, chosen starch, baking powder, yeast, sugar, and salt. This ensures all the dry ingredients are evenly distributed.
Incorporating the Water:
Next, slowly pour in the water while whisking continuously. Aim for a smooth, light batter that's not too thick but not runny either (consistency is key!). If you need a visual reference, check out the video linked below the recipe for a better understanding. 
Blending for Perfection:
Blend your mixture for at least a couple of minutes using a blender. 
The Rising Power of Baking Powder and Vinegar:
Add the baking powder, vinegar, and your vanilla or orange blossom extracts (optional) to the batter and blend again for another 2-3 minutes. This activates the baking powder, creating the signature air pockets that lead to those delightful thousand holes.
The Power of Patience:
Now comes the secret weapon – letting the batter rest! Cover the bowl and let it sit for 15-20 minutes. You'll witness the magic as the batter becomes bubblier at the top.
The Sizzle of Success:
Time to cook! Heat a non-stick crepe pan or similar pan over medium heat. Keep a damp cotton cloth or tissue nearby – you'll need it to wet the pan before making each Baghrir. This step is crucial for achieving the perfect texture.
Witnessing the Bubbles:
Pour a bit of batter onto the preheated pan. You'll see bubbles forming immediately – a sign that your batter is perfect!
One-Sided Wonders:
Unlike traditional pancakes, Baghrir are only cooked on one side. Resist the urge to flip! The key to those thousand holes lies in this one-sided cooking.
Judging Doneness:
As soon as you see no raw batter remaining and all the bubbles have formed, your Baghrir is ready.
Consistency is Key:
If you notice a lack of bubbles, it indicates a slightly thick batter. Don't worry! Simply adjust the consistency by adding a tablespoon of water at a time until you achieve the perfect flow.​
​
Classic Honey Butter Drizzle (for serving):
Ingredients:
3 tbsp Honey
1 tbsp Butter
Instructions:
In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the butter.
Once melted, remove from heat and stir in the honey until well combined.
Drizzle the warm honey butter mixture generously over your freshly cooked Baghrir and enjoy!

Storing Your Baghrir Delights: These delightful pancakes can be stored for later enjoyment!
Refrigerator: Place a sheet of parchment paper between each Baghrir to prevent sticking. Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
Freezer: For longer storage, consider freezing. Once completely cool, place a sheet of parchment paper between each Baghrir and store them in a freezer-safe ziplock bag for up to 2 months.

Reheating:
When ready to enjoy leftover Baghrir, you have a couple of options:
Microwaving: Pop your Baghrir in the microwave for a quick reheat. Aim for short bursts (around 10-15 seconds) and check for warmth in between.
Stovetop: Heat a pan over low heat and gently warm your Baghrir for a minute or two on each side. This method helps regain some of the fresh-off-the-pan fluffiness.

The Final Bite: A Baghrir Bonanza
With this recipe in hand, you're well on your way to becoming a Baghrir master! So ditch the ordinary and embrace the extraordinary with these light, fluffy, and visually stunning Moroccan pancakes. Experiment with various toppings – honey, butter, jam, or even fresh fruit – and discover your perfect Baghrir combination.

They're incredibly easy to make, perfect for a light breakfast, a decadent dessert, or a delightful brunch creation. Let's get started!
Picture
Instructions:
Here's a step-by-step guide to creating these amazing gluten-free crepes:

Ingredients (for 8 large crepes):
110 grams Rice Flour or Oat Flour (alternative for those with oat sensitivity)
65 grams Tapioca Starch (or chosen starch - potato, arrowroot, etc.)
45 grams Corn Flour, finely milled
1/3 teaspoon Xanthan Gum
2 tablespoons Sugar of choice (granulated, coconut sugar, etc.) or Sweetener of choice
1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract or Orange Blossom Water (optional)
2 Large Eggs (use 3 if small)
2 tablespoons Melted Butter or Neutral Oil (avocado, coconut)
440 ml Lactose-Free Milk (or plant-based milk of choice)
Pinch of Salt
Instructions:
Mixing the Dry Ingredients:
In a large bowl, whisk together the rice flour (or oat flour), tapioca starch, corn flour, xanthan gum, sugar (or sweetener), and salt. This ensures all the dry ingredients are evenly distributed.
Combining Wet and Dry Ingredients:
In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, vanilla extract (or orange blossom water, if using), and melted butter (or oil).
Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredient mixture while whisking continuously. This helps incorporate the wet ingredients without creating lumps.
Creating a Smooth Batter:
Once all the wet ingredients are incorporated, continue whisking until you have a smooth and slightly thick batter. If you notice any lumps, you can use an immersion blender or a hand mixer to remove them. Alternatively, you can strain the batter through a fine-mesh sieve to ensure a completely smooth consistency. This step is optional but helps achieve a silky texture.
Resting the Batter (Optional):
Letting the batter rest for 15-30 minutes allows the gluten-free flours to absorb moisture and can slightly improve the crepe's texture. However, this step is not essential and you can proceed to cooking the crepes immediately if preferred.
Heating the Crepe Pan:
Over medium heat, preheat a non-stick crepe pan or a well-seasoned cast iron skillet. A good indication that the pan is hot enough is a small drop of water sizzles and evaporates quickly.
Cooking the Crepes:
Lightly brush the hot pan with melted butter or oil to coat the surface.
Using a ladle or measuring cup, pour approximately 1/4 cup of batter into the center of the pan, tilting the pan to evenly distribute the batter and create a thin, circular crepe.
If you have a crepe spreader, this is the perfect time to utilize it! A crepe spreader is a T-shaped tool with a flat, circular base. Here's how to use it to achieve perfectly round crepes:
Hold the crepe spreader in your dominant hand with the base facing down towards the pan.
Quickly tilt the pan slightly towards you, allowing some of the runny batter to flow towards the bottom edge of the crepe.
With the crepe spreader, gently but firmly swipe across the bottom liquid batter, pushing it upwards and towards the center of the crepe. This will help spread the batter evenly and create a nice, thin circle.
Continue swirling the crepe spreader in a circular motion around the base of the crepe, working your way outwards towards the edges. Be careful not to press down too hard, or you might tear the delicate crepes.


Swirling and Cooking:
Once loosened, carefully flip the crepe using the spatula and cook for another 30-45 seconds on the other side.
As the edges of the crepe begin to set and the bottom becomes slightly golden brown (usually takes about 1-2 minutes), gently use a spatula to loosen the edges.
Stacking and Serving:
Transfer the cooked crepe to a plate and repeat steps 6 & 7 with the remaining batter.
Stack the cooked crepes on top of each other, separating them with a sheet of parchment paper to prevent sticking. This helps keep them warm and moist.
Tips for Success:
For perfectly round crepes, invest in a good quality crepe pan with shallow slightly sloped sides. However, a well-seasoned cast iron skillet can also work well.
If the batter seems too thick, add a tablespoon or two of additional milk (or plant-based milk) to thin it out slightly.
The first crepe may not be perfect, so don't be discouraged! Adjust the amount of batter you use based on the size of your pan and practice your swirling technique.
With a little practice, you'll be a crepe-flipping pro in no time! Now go forth and create these delightful gluten-free crepes, filled with your favorite sweet or savory toppings.

​Enjoy!
